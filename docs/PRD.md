6 Apr 2026
The provided documents detail the technical and product specifications for Nexus, a sophisticated enterprise assessment platform designed to evaluate human capability across six distinct domains. The system moves beyond simple questionnaires by utilizing a multi-layered architecture that includes psychometric scoring, contextual interpretation, and a robust governance engine. It is engineered to deliver highly regulated outputs, such as role-fit indices and behavioral profiles, while strictly limiting usage to validated developmental and hiring scenarios. Ethical safeguards and scientific discipline are central to the design, ensuring that sensitive data—like cognitive reasoning and personality traits—are reported only when specific confidence and validity thresholds are met. Ultimately, these sources establish a rigorous framework for transforming raw psychometric data into deterministic, audience-specific reports while maintaining strict enterprise control.

Discuss Applied Workplace Behavior.

Applied Workplace Behavior (also referred to as Domain 5: Applied Work and Leadership Expression) is a core component of the Nexus Assessment framework designed to measure how a person's underlying tendencies actually show up in their everyday work behavior
. In enterprise-facing reports, this domain is displayed under the name "Workplace Effectiveness"
.
The 8 Dimensions of Applied Workplace Behavior
Domain 5 synthesizes foundational traits into eight business-facing dimensions
:
Adaptability (D5-AD): Behavioral flexibility when dealing with change, novelty, and disruption
.
Culture Contribution (D5-CC): A person's typical impact on organizational norms, climate, and standards
.
Communication and Influence (D5-CI): The ability to communicate clearly and shape others' understanding or actions
.
Execution Discipline (D5-ED): Consistency in translating an intent or plan into actual delivery
.
Judgment and Decision Quality (D5-JDQ): The quality of practical work decisions made under constraints and consequences
.
Leadership Expression (D5-LE): The tendency and capability to set direction, mobilize others, and uphold standards
.
Team Contribution (D5-TC): The functional value a person adds to collective and collaborative work
.
Work Style (D5-WS): The typical pattern of how an individual plans, paces, structures, and executes tasks
.
Scoring and Synthesis Logic
Domain 5 acts as a "synthesis layer." Instead of purely relying on direct questions, it integrates direct applied items with overlapping data from foundational layers, such as Domain 1 (Personality), Domain 2 (Cognition), Domain 3 (Motivations), and Domain 4 (Emotional/Social)
.
Currently, all Domain 5 synthesis weights are operating on an equal-weight, provisional basis (synthesis_weight_version: 1.0.0-provisional) until further empirical refinement is finalized
.
Current Operational Status and Governance Restrictions
Within the Nexus platform's release cycle, Domain 5 is currently in a Pilot/Research state and is strictly deferred to Phase 2
. It is entirely blocked for high-stakes operational use (such as hiring and selection decisions)
.
This restriction is enforced by mandatory governance caveats:
Validation Prerequisites: Before Domain 5 can be fully operationalized, its synthesis relations must be validated, and the foundational domains (D1, D2, and D4) must complete their psychometric calibrations
.
Leadership Expression Limits: At V1, this dimension relies solely on self-report items. It requires multi-method evidence (such as Situational Judgment Tests, 360-degree reviews, or behavioral observations) before it can be used for any selection or high-consequence context
.
Judgment Context Limits: The Judgment and Decision Quality dimension currently measures general practical and ethical reasoning. Nexus governance mandates that it cannot be used for selection within a specific profession until domain-specific validation has been completed
.
Discuss Applied Workplace Behavior.

The measurement of Applied Workplace Behavior (Domain 5) relies on a highly structured item bank that employs various questioning methods to evaluate practical workplace effectiveness
. While the domain is currently in a pilot or research state and is operational_blocked for high-stakes decisions, the item design reveals a sophisticated approach to assessing how foundational traits manifest in everyday work
.
Assessment Methods and Item Formats To capture nuanced workplace behaviour, Nexus utilises three primary question formats:
Contextual Self-Report: Candidates rate the frequency (on a 1-5 scale) of specific workplace behaviours
. For example, evaluating Adaptability by asking if a candidate quickly adjusts priorities when new information arises, or measuring Work Style by asking if they double-check their work before submission
.
Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs): Candidates are presented with a multiple-choice scenario—such as managing a limited budget or handling a teammate who consistently misses deadlines—and must select the single strongest response
. This format is heavily used for evaluating complex trade-offs in Judgment and Decision Quality, Team Contribution, and Leadership Expression
.
Forced-Choice Paired Statements: To prevent candidates from simply picking the most socially desirable answer ("superiority signalling"), Nexus uses paired statements where candidates must choose between two equally valid working styles (e.g., preferring to close a task out quickly versus keeping the approach flexible)
.
Construct Precision and Bias Prevention A major focus of the Domain 5 item bank is avoiding "prohibited overlap." This ensures the questions measure genuine competence rather than superficial traits, identity, or negative behaviours masquerading as positive ones:
Leadership Expression is designed to measure constructive direction-setting and mobilisation, deliberately avoiding item phrasing that could reward "harshness as strength," micromanagement, or "charisma image only"
.
Adaptability focuses on true behavioural flexibility, context switching, and learning-in-action, ensuring it does not mistakenly measure "busyness as adaptability" or mere "novelty seeking"
.
Culture & Team Contribution focus on accountability, inclusion, and practical supportiveness rather than just generic "niceness," "warmth," or compliance
.
Job Level Calibration and Reverse Scoring While many dimensions like Adaptability, Work Style, and Communication are tested across all_levels, specific dimensions are strictly targeted at manager_plus roles
. For instance, items assessing Delegation Inclination, Accountability Leadership, and maintaining an Accountability Climate are reserved for managerial assessments
. Furthermore, to catch inconsistent or dishonest responding, Nexus integrates reverse-scored items, such as statements where a candidate admits to avoiding responsibility for decisions, missing deadlines, or ignoring team confusion
.
How do items for manager roles differ from other levels?
What is the purpose of reverse-scored statements in the bank?
How does the platform prevent candidates from using superiority signalling?
Discuss Personality Architecture.

Personality Architecture (Domain 1) is a foundational layer of the Nexus Assessment framework that measures core personality traits across six dimensions. It utilizes various question formats, including Likert scales, forced-choice pairs, and Situational Judgment Tests, to assess traits ranging from Conscientious Execution to Social Assertiveness, providing the foundational data that ultimately informs applied work behaviors
.
Connection to Applied Workplace Behavior
As discussed previously, Applied Workplace Behavior (Domain 5) acts as a synthesis layer. Personality Architecture (Domain 1) serves as one of the critical foundational layers that feeds into Domain 5
. The core personality traits measured in Domain 1 provide the underlying data that Nexus synthesizes to predict how those traits will actually manifest in everyday workplace effectiveness.
The 6 Dimensions of Personality Architecture
The Domain 1 item bank is organized into six primary dimensions, each containing specific sub-facets:
Conscientious Execution (D1-CE): Measures reliability and work ethic through facets including Dependability, Follow-Through, Organization, Self-Discipline, and Time Discipline
.
Exploratory Openness (D1-EO): Evaluates a candidate's intellectual and creative adaptability, assessing Ambiguity Tolerance, Conceptual Range, Creativity, Curiosity, and Learning Appetite
.
Emotional Steadiness (D1-ES): Captures how a person handles strain through facets like Composure, Frustration Control, Pressure Stability, Recovery Speed, and Stress Tolerance
.
Integrity Orientation (D1-IN): Focuses on ethical workplace conduct by measuring Accountability, Fairness, Honesty, Humility, Non-Exploitation, and Rule Regard
.
Interpersonal Orientation (D1-IO): Assesses how an individual relates to others through Cooperation, Conflict Restraint, Empathy, Respect, and Tact
.
Social Assertiveness (D1-SA): Measures how a person projects themselves in group settings via Energy Expression, Influence Projection, Social Confidence, Visibility Comfort, and Voice
.
Assessment Methods and Item Formats
Similar to the methodology used in Domain 5, Personality Architecture relies on a mix of question formats to ensure precision and prevent candidates from simply "faking good":
Likert Statements and Contextual Self-Reports: Candidates rate their agreement (1-5 scale) or the frequency of specific behaviors, such as whether they keep their files systematically arranged or if they start meetings on time
.
Forced-Choice Paired Statements: These "overlay" items force candidates to choose between two equally desirable traits to evaluate their tradeoffs
. For example, candidates might have to choose between completing tasks thoroughly before moving on versus balancing task completion with adapting to new priorities
.
Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs): Scenario-based questions are used to test traits in context. For instance, Integrity Orientation is tested by asking candidates how they would respond to discovering a coworker improperly billing expenses
.
Reverse-Scoring: To catch inconsistent or overly favorable self-reporting, the bank uses reverse-scored items (e.g., asking if a candidate often leaves projects unfinished when they become difficult)
.
Job Leveling and Governance
While the majority of Personality Architecture items are administered across all job levels (all_levels), certain facets are restricted to higher roles
. For example, items measuring "Conceptual Range" and "Creativity" are targeted at professional_plus roles, while "Tact" is reserved for manager_plus roles
. Additionally, while most of Domain 1 is fully allowed for operational use, dimensions like Integrity Orientation are marked as operational_allowed_with_restrictions
.
How does Social Assertiveness influence Leadership Expression in Domain 5?
What specific restrictions apply to using Integrity Orientation in hiring?
Which personality facets are restricted to manager and professional roles?
Discuss Platform Architecture.

The Nexus Assessment Platform Architecture is designed not simply as a questionnaire tool, but as a highly regulated, multidimensional measurement ecosystem
. It is built to assess human capability and behavioral expression across all job levels while maintaining strict scientific, ethical, and enterprise governance
.
To achieve this, the architecture is structured across two primary frameworks: a Seven-Layer System Architecture that handles the technical progression of data, and a Product Architecture that defines the platform's core capabilities
.
The Seven-Layer System Architecture
Data in Nexus moves through seven distinct operational layers, ensuring that every score is measured, validated, and governed before it is ever reported
:
Layer 1: Session Orchestration: Determines the assessment path, module sequence, and routing for the candidate
.
Layer 2: Measurement: Administers the actual items and tasks, capturing raw responses and response-process signals (like response time)
.
Layer 3: Response Quality: Detects careless, inconsistent, overly managed (impression management), or invalid responding to flag or disqualify low-quality data
.
Layer 4: Psychometric Scoring: Computes the actual scale and trait levels (Theta scores) and estimates the precision/confidence of those scores
.
Layer 5: Profile Modeling: Combines primary scores into interpretable domain profiles and facet patterns
.
Layer 6: Contextual Interpretation: Maps the psychometric scores to specific job levels, role families, and use cases to generate role-relevant summaries and fit inputs
.
Layer 7: Governance: The final safeguard that constrains what is actually reported, enforcing use permissions, redactions, confidence warnings, and enterprise rules
.
The Core Product Layers
Conceptually, Nexus organizes its platform into distinct structural layers
:
Construct Architecture: Defines what is measured (the 6 Domains, including the previously discussed Personality Architecture and Applied Workplace Behavior)
.
Assessment Architecture: Defines how traits are measured utilizing a multidimensional item bank and adaptive assembly
.
Scoring Architecture: Dictates how scores are estimated, standard errors are calculated, and derived outputs are generated
.
Role-Fit Architecture: Governs how job context is integrated, relying on strictly validated "role blueprints" to generate fit indices
.
Reporting Architecture: A deterministic engine that controls what appears to whom, generating audience-specific reports (e.g., candidate vs. hiring manager vs. executive)
.
Governance Architecture: Defines the product limits, enforcing enterprise controls, fairness standards, and release rules
.
Modular Design and Job-Level Routing
The assessment experience itself is highly modular. Every candidate completes a Universal Identity and Consent module, alongside Core Noncognitive (Personality/Emotional) and Core Cognitive modules
. Other modules, like Motivation and Applied Workplace Behavior, are integrated based on the platform's phased releases and specific use cases
.
The architecture also employs Job-Level Routing Logic to tailor the assessment's emphasis
:
Entry-Level / Individual Contributors: Focuses on foundational dispositions, basic reasoning, execution, communication, and coachability
.
Managers: Adds a people-leadership overlay, emphasizing delegation, prioritization, judgment, and team climate
.
Senior Leaders / Executives: Activates complex overlays assessing systems thinking, long-horizon trade-offs, ethical authority, and ambiguity handling
.
This document is the implementation-ready technical specification for the **Nexus Assessment** platform. It translates the finalized questionnaire bank, the current governance model, the derived **Domain 6** framework, and the governed **role-fit** architecture into a practical engineering specification for backend, frontend, data, analytics, psychometrics, and product teams.

The document assumes the current Nexus design has already locked the following product decisions. First, the questionnaire bank contains a governed master bank of **543 items** across **34 dimensions** in **Domains 1–5**. Second, **Domain 6** is **not** a direct questionnaire domain and must be computed as a **derived person-in-context layer** after questionnaire scoring. Third, the **role-fit agent** must consume validated role blueprints and Domain 6 outputs rather than infer fit directly from raw questionnaire responses. Fourth, pilot and research domains must remain governed and operationally restricted until validation thresholds are met.

This specification is intended to let the engineering team start implementation without having to reconstruct the product logic from scattered design documents.

## 2. Source-of-truth artifacts

The current technical design should be anchored to the following internal artifacts, which function as the governing source set for implementation.

| Artifact | Technical purpose |
|---|---|
| `nexus_governed_master_questionnaire_bank_final.csv` | Master questionnaire bank and item-level schema |
| `nexus_governed_master_questionnaire_bank_final.xlsx` | Workbook representation of the same governed bank |
| `nexus_governed_master_questionnaire_bank_summary_final.md` | Final bank counts, blueprint coverage, method mix, and governance summary |
| `nexus_governed_master_questionnaire_validation_report_final.csv` | Final validation status and schema checks |
| `nexus_domain6_framework_and_context_form.md` | Domain 6 derived scoring architecture, formulas, context schema, and reporting logic |
| `nexus_role_fit_validity_framework.md` | Governed role blueprint and role-fit validity model |
| `nexus_governed_master_questionnaire_blueprint_final.csv` | Final blueprint view of bank composition |
| `nexus_dif_governance_register_final.csv` | DIF quarantine and flag carry-forward register |
| `nexus_forced_choice_expansion_register_final.csv` | Forced-choice expansion governance register |
| `nexus_precision_expansion_register_final.csv` | Item expansion and minimum-per-dimension precision support register |
| `nexus_style_detection_support_register_final.csv` | Response-style resistance and style-detection support register |

Engineering should treat the **CSV bank** and the **Domain 6 framework** as the primary executable sources for the scoring and data contracts.

## 3. Product scope and system boundary

The Nexus platform is not a single questionnaire renderer. It is a **multi-layer assessment system**. The first layer administers and scores the psychometric bank across Domains 1–5. The second layer applies governance and interpretive controls. The third layer computes Domain 6 from person scores plus explicit context inputs. The fourth layer uses governed role blueprints to generate role-fit outputs for hiring, internal mobility, development, or scenario-based decision support.

| Layer | System responsibility | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Assessment Delivery** | Render items, collect responses, manage sessions, apply administration rules | Raw responses and completion metadata |
| **Scoring Engine** | Score Domains 1–5, reverse-score items, compute dimension and domain results, apply method-specific logic | Standardized person profile |
| **Governance Engine** | Carry forward DIF flags, bank-state rules, confidence logic, and operational restrictions | Governed assessment result |
| **Domain 6 Engine** | Compare person profile to context profile and compute derived indices | CAI, DII, and secondary indices |
| **Role-Fit Engine / Agent** | Compare person-in-context results to approved role blueprint and generate fit interpretation | Fit score, fit band, strengths, risks, narrative |
| **Reporting Layer** | Generate candidate, admin, and role-fit views under governance rules | Reports, dashboards, downloadable summaries |

This separation is essential. It allows the platform to preserve psychometric scoring integrity while still supporting contextual interpretation and downstream fit decisions.

## 4. Final questionnaire architecture

The finalized governed master bank contains **543 items**, **34 dimensions**, and the following locked method mix.

| Method family | Response scale | Item count | Implementation implication |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `likert` | `1-5 Agreement` | 187 | Standard agreement items with reverse scoring support |
| `contextual_self_report` | `1-5 Frequency` | 200 | Contextual behavior-frequency items; must not use agreement scale |
| `forced_choice` | `forced_choice_binary` | 54 | Pairwise or binary forced-choice scoring logic |
| `cognitive_multiple_choice` | `cognitive_mcq` | 90 | Multiple-choice keyed-answer scoring |
| `sjt` | `sjt_single_best` | 12 | Situational judgment keyed-best-response logic |

The bank spans **Domains 1–5**, while **Domain 6** remains derived-only. The active domain states and operational restrictions must be enforced at runtime.

| Domain | Description | Current state | Operational interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Personality Architecture | Production | Operationally usable |
| **D2** | Cognitive Architecture | Production | Operationally usable, with some level restrictions |
| **D3** | Values and Motivational Drivers | Pilot / Research mix | Blocked for high-stakes operational use |
| **D4** | Interpersonal and Emotional Functioning | Production | Operationally usable, some dimensions restricted |
| **D5** | Applied Workplace Behavior | Pilot / Research mix | Blocked for high-stakes operational use |
| **D6** | Contextual Alignment and Decision Influence | Derived only | Computed after scoring; no direct questionnaire items |

The current bank also preserves critical calibration remediations. All contextual items use `1-5 Frequency`, reverse-scored non-cognitive coverage is above the minimum target band, forced-choice expansion has been added for response-style resistance, and top-severity DIF items are quarantined through governance markers rather than silently deleted.

## 5. Domain and dimension structure

The engineering implementation should treat **dimension** as the primary stable scoring unit. Raw items roll up to facets where applicable, but operational scoring and downstream integration should rely mostly on dimension-level scores because dimension outputs are more stable, easier to validate, and easier to govern.

| Domain | Dimension count | Core implementation note |
|---|---:|---|
| **D1** Personality Architecture | 6 | Non-cognitive; includes reverse-scored items and level overlays |
| **D2** Cognitive Architecture | 6 | Fully cognitive; all items use keyed-answer logic |
| **D3** Values and Motivational Drivers | 8 | Present in bank but operationally restricted |
| **D4** Interpersonal and Emotional Functioning | 6 | Mixed contextual, likert, forced-choice, and SJT support |
| **D5** Applied Workplace Behavior | 8 | Present in bank but operationally restricted |

The 34 current dimensions are as follows.

| Domain | Dimensions |
|---|---|
| **D1** | D1-CE, D1-EO, D1-ES, D1-IN, D1-IO, D1-SA |
| **D2** | D2-AR, D2-DC, D2-LA, D2-NR, D2-SST, D2-VR |
| **D3** | D3-AD, D3-AF, D3-AUD, D3-ID, D3-LD, D3-PU, D3-RO, D3-SD |
| **D4** | D4-RC, D4-RM, D4-SA, D4-SO, D4-SR, D4-TC |
| **D5** | D5-AD, D5-CC, D5-CI, D5-ED, D5-JDQ, D5-LE, D5-TC, D5-WS |

## 6. Production questionnaire item schema

The final CSV bank currently uses the following header and this exact column order should be preserved in importers, validation jobs, internal admin tools, and build pipelines.

| Column | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `item_id` | string | Yes | Globally unique item identifier such as `NEX-GMB-001` |
| `domain_id` | string | Yes | Primary domain code, e.g. `D1` |
| `domain_name` | string | Yes | Human-readable domain label |
| `dimension_id` | string | Yes | Dimension code, e.g. `D1-CE` |
| `dimension_name` | string | Yes | Human-readable dimension label |
| `facet_id` | string | Yes | Facet code |
| `facet_name` | string | Yes | Human-readable facet name |
| `method_family` | enum | Yes | `likert`, `contextual_self_report`, `forced_choice`, `cognitive_multiple_choice`, `sjt` |
| `item_format` | enum | Yes | Rendering format such as `statement` |
| `item_text` | text | Yes | Primary prompt or statement |
| `option_a` | text | Conditional | Option A for forced-choice, cognitive, or SJT |
| `option_b` | text | Conditional | Option B |
| `option_c` | text | Conditional | Option C |
| `option_d` | text | Conditional | Option D |
| `option_e` | text | Conditional | Option E |
| `keyed_answer` | string | Conditional | Correct or preferred answer key for scored non-Likert methods |
| `response_scale` | enum | Yes | `1-5 Agreement`, `1-5 Frequency`, `forced_choice_binary`, `cognitive_mcq`, `sjt_single_best` |
| `primary_domain_id` | string | Yes | Governing primary domain linkage |
| `primary_dimension_id` | string | Yes | Governing primary dimension linkage |
| `primary_facet_id` | string | Yes | Governing primary facet linkage |
| `secondary_dimension_ids` | string/list | Optional | Comma-delimited secondary overlaps for governance review |
| `loading_type` | enum | Yes | Loading pattern such as `adjacent` |
| `intended_meaning` | text | Yes | Construct intent statement |
| `prohibited_overlap` | text | Optional | Construct area to avoid conflation with |
| `bank_state` | enum | Yes | `production`, `pilot`, or `research` |
| `use_status` | enum | Yes | Operational permission state |
| `validation_track` | string/list | Yes | Validation flags such as `calibration,discriminant` |
| `job_level_overlay` | enum/string | Yes | Audience or level restrictions |
| `reverse_scored` | boolean | Yes for non-cognitive | Whether scoring direction must be flipped |
| `review_status` | enum | Yes | Current review state |
| `reviewer_notes` | text | Optional | Governance and authoring notes |

The ingestion service should reject files that change column names, reorder required columns without mapping metadata, or introduce unsupported method-scale combinations.

## 7. Method-specific rendering and validation rules

The delivery layer must not treat all items as interchangeable. Each method family requires its own rendering logic, input validation, and scoring behavior.

| Method family | Render pattern | Required fields | Scoring rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `likert` | Single statement with 1–5 agreement scale | `item_text`, `response_scale`, `reverse_scored` | Numeric score 1–5; reverse if flagged |
| `contextual_self_report` | Context behavior statement with 1–5 frequency scale | `item_text`, `response_scale`, `reverse_scored` | Numeric score 1–5; reverse if flagged |
| `forced_choice` | Pairwise binary choice between two keyed alternatives | `item_text` or standard instruction line, paired options, keyed mapping | Convert choice to trait-keyed polarity or pairwise score |
| `cognitive_multiple_choice` | Stem plus 4–5 options | `item_text`, options, `keyed_answer` | 1 for correct, 0 for incorrect, optionally IRT-ready later |
| `sjt` | Scenario plus options, single best answer | `item_text`, options, `keyed_answer` | Single-best keyed score, later expandable to partial-credit model |

The validation service must enforce the following minimal method contracts.

| Method family | Validation contract |
|---|---|
| `likert` | `response_scale` must equal `1-5 Agreement`; `keyed_answer` must be empty; at least `item_text` must exist |
| `contextual_self_report` | `response_scale` must equal `1-5 Frequency`; `keyed_answer` must be empty |
| `forced_choice` | `response_scale` must equal `forced_choice_binary`; at least two options must exist; scoring key must be inferable from schema or pair map |
| `cognitive_multiple_choice` | `response_scale` must equal `cognitive_mcq`; options A–D required, E optional; `keyed_answer` required |
| `sjt` | `response_scale` must equal `sjt_single_best`; options required; `keyed_answer` required |

## 8. Assessment delivery architecture

The assessment application should be implemented as a **session-based adaptive delivery shell** even if the first release does not yet include psychometric adaptivity. The session system must support resumability, method-aware rendering, audit logging, timed sections for cognitive methods if enabled, and governance-aware blocking of restricted scales in operational contexts.

| Delivery component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Session service** | Creates assessment sessions, stores state, supports pause and resume |
| **Item selection service** | Chooses which bank items are delivered for a given form or program |
| **Renderer** | Displays item based on `method_family` and `response_scale` |
| **Response capture service** | Validates and stores user responses with timestamps |
| **Quality-control service** | Records missingness, latency, straightlining indicators, contradiction checks, and forced-choice completion consistency |
| **Completion service** | Closes sections, computes eligibility for scoring, and emits scoring job |

The team should separate **bank administration** from **form assembly**. The governed master bank is not what every candidate necessarily sees in one sitting. Production forms can be assembled from the bank according to program rules, role family, job level, validation state, and release policy.

## 9. Recommended system components

A service-oriented internal design is recommended even if the first implementation deploys as a modular monolith. The reason is that the Nexus product contains clearly separable responsibilities that will become difficult to maintain if deeply entangled.

| Service / module | Core responsibility | Suggested storage ownership |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity and Access** | Users, admins, managers, assessor roles, API credentials | User/auth tables |
| **Bank Registry** | Item bank versions, import jobs, release states, governance metadata | Bank and item tables |
| **Form Assembly** | Assessment form definition, versioning, program rules | Form tables |
| **Assessment Runtime** | Sessions, page state, timers, responses, completion | Session and response tables |
| **Scoring Engine** | Item scoring, dimension scoring, standardization, QC flags | Result tables |
| **Governance Engine** | DIF carry-forward, restrictions, confidence, release policy | Governance tables |
| **Context Service** | Context forms, role templates, scenario definitions | Context tables |
| **Domain 6 Engine** | CAI, DII, secondary indices, confidence statement | Domain 6 results tables |
| **Role Blueprint Service** | Role evidence intake, blueprint approval, weights, thresholds | Role blueprint tables |
| **Role-Fit Engine** | Candidate-role matching and interpretive output | Role-fit result tables |
| **Reporting Service** | Report generation, dashboards, export jobs | Report metadata |
| **Audit and Analytics** | Event logs, calibration data, psychometric monitoring | Event and analytics warehouse |

## 10. End-to-end scoring pipeline

The scoring flow should be deterministic, asynchronous, and fully auditable. A background job architecture is recommended because scoring can include multiple dependent passes: raw scoring, quality-control checks, standardization, governance, Domain 6 derivation, and role-fit interpretation.

| Stage | Input | Processing | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Response finalization** | Session responses | Check completion, missingness, method validity | Locked response payload |
| **2. Item scoring** | Locked responses + bank metadata | Reverse scoring, keyed-answer scoring, forced-choice mapping | Item-level scored responses |
| **3. Aggregate scoring** | Scored items | Compute facet, dimension, domain, and method summaries | Raw score profile |
| **4. Standardization** | Raw scores + norms/config | Convert raw scores to standardized scores | Standardized person profile |
| **5. Quality control** | Scored profile + response metadata | Detect style issues, contradictions, DIF exposure, low precision | QC and governance flags |
| **6. Governance pass** | Standardized profile + governance rules | Block restricted outputs, compute confidence, quarantine flagged content | Governed profile |
| **7. Domain 6 derivation** | Governed profile + context record | Compute CAI, DII, AFI, ECFI, SII, DDI, PDRI, ECSI | Domain 6 result |
| **8. Role-fit scoring** | Governed profile + Domain 6 + approved role blueprint | Compute fit score, fit band, strengths, and risks | Role-fit result |
| **9. Reporting** | All prior outputs | Build user-specific report views under permissions | Candidate/admin/assessor reports |

## 11. Item scoring logic

### 11.1 Likert and contextual scoring

For `likert` and `contextual_self_report` items, the response value should be stored as an ordinal integer from **1** to **5**. Reverse-scored items must be flipped before aggregation using the simple transformation:

```text
reversed_score = 6 - raw_score
```

This rule applies only to non-cognitive items flagged as `reverse_scored = true`.

### 11.2 Cognitive multiple-choice scoring

For `cognitive_multiple_choice` items, the runtime captures the selected option and compares it against `keyed_answer`.

```text
item_score = 1 if selected_option == keyed_answer else 0
```

The first release should use classical keyed scoring. The architecture should nevertheless preserve support for future IRT or difficulty-parameter extensions by storing item-level correctness separately from higher-level scale summaries.

### 11.3 Situational judgment scoring

For `sjt` items, the first release should also use keyed-best-response scoring.

```text
item_score = 1 if selected_option == keyed_answer else 0
```

A later release may introduce partial-credit models if calibration evidence supports that change.

### 11.4 Forced-choice scoring

Forced-choice items should not be flattened into ordinary Likert-like values. They require either pairwise keyed logic or ipsative/partial-ipsative scoring rules depending on how the pair was authored. The current bank uses forced-choice as a response-style resistance layer rather than as a standalone primary scale. Therefore, first-release scoring can use a governed pairwise mapping table that translates each forced-choice response into one or more dimension contributions.

| Forced-choice release recommendation | Implementation detail |
|---|---|
| **Store each option’s keyed target** | Add a pair-map config table rather than overloading bank CSV columns |
| **Score by selected keyed pole** | Increment contribution to the keyed dimension/pole |
| **Do not normalize as raw Likert mean** | Keep separate method-weight handling in aggregation |
| **Retain raw choice trail** | Needed for audit, style detection, and future recalibration |

## 12. Aggregate scoring model

The bank should be aggregated in stages. The first release should compute **item -> facet -> dimension -> domain** summaries. However, downstream interpretation, Domain 6, and role-fit should primarily consume **dimension-level standardized scores**.

| Level | Recommended computation |
|---|---|
| **Facet raw score** | Mean or sum of scored items mapped to facet |
| **Dimension raw score** | Weighted or unweighted aggregate of facets/items in the dimension |
| **Domain raw score** | Aggregate of dimension scores within domain |
| **Standardized score** | Convert raw level to 0–100 or normed metric based on calibration config |

The platform should store both **raw scores** and **standardized scores** because psychometric maintenance, calibration work, and future norm updates require reproducibility.

## 13. Standardization and norms layer

The current documentation and build artifacts imply a standardized **0–100** dimension representation is the correct operational layer for Domain 6 and role-fit. The scoring engine should therefore support a norm/config table that maps raw dimension results into standardized outputs.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `norm_version` | Identifies the standardization release used |
| `dimension_id` | Dimension to which the rule applies |
| `population_segment` | Optional norm segment such as job family or level |
| `raw_min` / `raw_max` | Expected raw range |
| `transform_type` | Linear, percentile, z-score-derived, or lookup table |
| `standardized_output_min` / `max` | Usually 0 and 100 |
| `effective_date` | Governance and reproducibility |

The first release may use a controlled linear or lookup transform if empirical norms are not yet final. The implementation must keep the transform versioned so historical reports remain reproducible.

## 14. Quality control and response-style safeguards

Nexus already expanded forced-choice content and reverse coverage to improve resistance to careless, acquiescent, or stylized responding. The platform therefore needs a dedicated **response-quality layer** rather than treating the questionnaire as a simple survey.

| QC signal | Operational purpose |
|---|---|
| **Straightlining detection** | Detect low variance responding across same-scale blocks |
| **Reverse inconsistency checks** | Detect agreement with both positive and negative trait statements |
| **Latency anomalies** | Detect unrealistically fast completion or block-level speed issues |
| **Missingness and abandonment** | Detect incomplete or low-engagement sessions |
| **Forced-choice inconsistency** | Detect unstable polarity across mirrored pairs |
| **Cognitive section timing anomalies** | Detect non-serious engagement or unusual administration conditions |
| **DIF exposure flags** | Carry forward governance warnings on flagged items/scales |

The system should not automatically invalidate a result solely because one QC rule triggers. Instead, the governance engine should convert QC signals into **confidence states**, **warnings**, **suppression rules**, or **manual review requirements**.

## 15. Governance model

The governance layer is a first-class system, not a reporting afterthought. This is especially important because the final bank explicitly contains production, pilot, and research content in the same governed master bank.

| Governance field | System use |
|---|---|
| `bank_state` | Determines maturity of the item or scale |
| `use_status` | Determines whether output may appear operationally |
| `validation_track` | Tracks calibration, discriminant, or further study needs |
| `review_status` | Tracks review workflow |
| `reviewer_notes` | Human-readable governance rationale |
| DIF registers | Suppress or warn on quarantined items/scales |

The minimum runtime governance rules should be the following.

| Rule | Required system behavior |
|---|---|
| **Operationally blocked scales** | Must not appear as decision-driving outputs in high-stakes operational reports |
| **Pilot or research bank states** | May appear only in research, calibration, or explicitly provisional reporting modes |
| **Quarantined DIF items** | Must be excluded, down-weighted, or flagged according to governance config |
| **Low-confidence profiles** | Must show confidence label and restrict strong interpretive language |
| **Domain 6 dependence on provisional content** | Must reduce Domain 6 confidence accordingly |
| **Role-fit on unapproved role blueprint** | Must not produce high-stakes or definitive fit decisions |

## 16. Domain 6 technical architecture

**Domain 6** is a post-scoring derived engine. It must not alter raw Domains 1–5 scores. Instead, it consumes the standardized person profile and an explicit context record.

| Domain 6 input layer | Technical source |
|---|---|
| **Person profile** | Standardized dimension scores from Domains 1–5 plus governance flags |
| **Context profile** | 17-field short context form or approved role-template record |
| **Governance context** | QC flags, DIF flags, blocked domains, blueprint approval status |

The current production recommendation includes **two primary outputs** and **six secondary outputs**.

| Index | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **CAI** | Contextual Alignment Index |
| **DII** | Decision Influence Index |
| **AFI** | Ambiguity Fit Index |
| **ECFI** | Execution-Context Fit Index |
| **SII** | Stakeholder-Influence Index |
| **DDI** | Decision Discipline Index |
| **PDRI** | Pressure Distortion Risk Index |
| **ECSI** | Ethical Constraint Stability Index |

### 16.1 Context form schema

The implementation should support a short structured context object with the following minimum fields.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `context_id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `context_name` | string | Role/scenario name |
| `job_family` | enum | Strategy, Operations, Sales, Product, Engineering, People, Finance, Risk, General Management, Other |
| `job_level` | enum | IC, Professional, Manager, Senior Manager, Director, Executive |
| `leadership_scope` | integer | 0–4 |
| `ambiguity_level` | integer | 1–5 |
| `decision_stakes` | integer | 1–5 |
| `time_pressure` | integer | 1–5 |
| `regulatory_constraint` | integer | 1–5 |
| `autonomy_level` | integer | 1–5 |
| `stakeholder_complexity` | integer | 1–5 |
| `interdependence_level` | integer | 1–5 |
| `innovation_demand` | integer | 1–5 |
| `execution_precision_demand` | integer | 1–5 |
| `customer_exposure` | integer | 1–5 |
| `conflict_load` | integer | 1–5 |
| `change_velocity` | integer | 1–5 |
| `failure_cost` | integer | 1–5 |
| `success_profile_notes` | text | Optional narrative notes |

### 16.2 Contextual Alignment Index formula

The current recommended implementation formula is:

```text
CAI = 100 - 100 * ( sum(Wd * abs(Pd - Rd)) / (sum(Wd) * 100) ) - sum(Gd)
```

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Pd` | Standardized person score on dimension `d` |
| `Rd` | Required level for dimension `d` in the context template |
| `Wd` | Weight of dimension `d` in the template |
| `Gd` | Governance penalty if flagged constraints apply |

Recommended interpretation bands are as follows.

| CAI range | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 80–100 | Strong contextual fit |
| 65–79 | Good fit with manageable stretch |
| 50–64 | Mixed or conditional fit |
| 35–49 | Weak fit |
| 0–34 | Poor fit |

### 16.3 Decision Influence Index formula

The current recommended implementation formula is:

```text
DII = 0.30 * DDI + 0.20 * AFI + 0.15 * SII + 0.15 * ECSI - 0.20 * PDRI
```

This makes DII interpretable rather than opaque. High decision discipline, ambiguity fit, stakeholder control, and ethical stability raise the score; high pressure distortion lowers it.

### 16.4 Secondary index formulas

The first release should implement the currently recommended formulas as configurable weighted composites rather than hard-coded constants spread across code.

| Index | Recommended formula |
|---|---|
| **AFI** | `0.35 * D2 ambiguity-handling + 0.25 * D2 systems reasoning + 0.20 * D4 resilience + 0.20 * D5 adaptability` |
| **ECFI** | `0.35 * D5 disciplined execution + 0.25 * D1 conscientious execution + 0.20 * D5 workload structure + 0.20 * D1 integrity/compliance orientation` |
| **SII** | `0.30 * D3 influence drive + 0.20 * D3 affiliation + 0.20 * D4 social regulation + 0.15 * D1 self-awareness - 0.15 * approval-dependent distortion flag` |
| **DDI** | `0.35 * D2 decision quality + 0.25 * D5 judgment quality + 0.20 * D4 self-regulation + 0.20 * D1 conscientious execution` |
| **PDRI** | `0.35 * low D4 self-regulation + 0.25 * low D4 resilience + 0.20 * high motive pressure + 0.20 * high time-pressure context interaction` |
| **ECSI** | `0.40 * D1 integrity + 0.20 * D1 conscientious execution + 0.20 * D4 self-regulation + 0.20 * low motive-pressure distortion` |

The best implementation pattern is to store these as **versioned formula configurations** mapped to dimension IDs and transformation rules.

### 16.5 Domain 6 confidence logic

The Domain 6 engine must emit a confidence value because the derived layer depends on both source-scale quality and context quality.

| Condition | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Stable source scales, no major flags, explicit context | `High` |
| Some provisional or pilot/research dependence | `Moderate` |
| Major DIF, quarantined content, weak profile precision, or poor context definition | `Provisional` |

## 17. Role blueprint and role-fit architecture

The role-fit layer must consume a governed **Role Blueprint** object. The role-fit service should never rely on job title alone.

| Role blueprint field | Description |
|---|---|
| `role_id` | Unique role identifier |
| `role_title` | Human-readable title |
| `role_level` | Level band |
| `job_family` | Functional family |
| `context_flags` | Context descriptors such as regulated or innovation-heavy |
| `critical_outcomes` | Measurable success targets |
| `critical_tasks` | Ranked task list |
| `required_dimensions` | Dimensions included in fit model |
| `excluded_dimensions` | Dimensions intentionally not used |
| `dimension_weights` | Role-fit weights |
| `rationale` | Why each dimension matters |
| `evidence_sources` | Source list supporting blueprint |
| `confidence_score` | Evidence completeness and agreement score |
| `approval_status` | `draft`, `reviewed`, `approved`, `validated` |

The role blueprint process should preserve the five-layer validity logic already defined conceptually: intake, translation, verification, approval, and validation.

### 17.1 Role-fit score formula

The role-fit engine should use only approved role blueprint dimensions and weights.

```text
Fit = sum( wd * similarity(Sd, Td) ) / sum(wd)
```

A simple default similarity function is:

```text
similarity(Sd, Td) = 1 - abs(Sd - Td)
```

Where scores are normalized to 0–1 or equivalently standardized to 0–100 and rescaled internally.

Recommended operational bands are:

| Fit score | Band |
|---|---|
| 85–100 | Strong Fit |
| 75–84 | Good Fit |
| 60–74 | Conditional Fit |
| Below 60 | Weak Fit |

The role-fit engine should also expose the top positive gaps, top negative gaps, role-critical threshold failures, and confidence modifiers.

## 18. Database model

A relational core with analytics export is the best fit for Nexus. PostgreSQL is recommended for transactional storage, with a warehouse or analytical mirror later if usage scales.

### 18.1 Core entity model

| Table | Purpose | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Candidate, admin, manager, assessor identities | `user_id`, `role_type`, auth fields |
| `item_banks` | Bank versions and release states | `bank_id`, `version`, `status`, `created_at` |
| `items` | Questionnaire items | all item schema fields plus foreign keys |
| `forms` | Deliverable assessment forms assembled from bank | `form_id`, `bank_id`, `form_type`, `status` |
| `form_items` | Item order and form membership | `form_id`, `item_id`, section/order metadata |
| `assessment_sessions` | Runtime instances | `session_id`, `user_id`, `form_id`, state, started/completed times |
| `responses` | Raw captured responses | `response_id`, `session_id`, `item_id`, answer payload, timestamps |
| `scoring_runs` | Scoring job metadata | `scoring_run_id`, `session_id`, `norm_version`, status |
| `item_scores` | Item-level scored outputs | `scoring_run_id`, `item_id`, scored value |
| `dimension_scores` | Dimension-level raw and standardized outputs | `scoring_run_id`, `dimension_id`, raw_score, standardized_score |
| `domain_scores` | Domain summaries | `scoring_run_id`, `domain_id`, raw_score, standardized_score |
| `qc_flags` | Response quality and governance signals | `scoring_run_id`, flag_code, severity |
| `contexts` | Short context form instances or imported context records | `context_id`, all context fields |
| `domain6_runs` | Domain 6 jobs | `domain6_run_id`, `scoring_run_id`, `context_id`, version |
| `domain6_scores` | Domain 6 primary and secondary indices | `domain6_run_id`, index_code, score |
| `role_blueprints` | Role profile objects | `role_blueprint_id`, approval state, confidence |
| `role_blueprint_dimensions` | Required dimensions and weights | `role_blueprint_id`, `dimension_id`, required_level, weight |
| `role_fit_runs` | Candidate-role evaluation jobs | `role_fit_run_id`, `scoring_run_id`, `domain6_run_id`, `role_blueprint_id` |
| `role_fit_outputs` | Fit outputs and interpretive details | fit score, band, strengths, risks, notes |
| `audit_events` | Immutable system event log | actor, event, target, timestamp, payload |

### 18.2 Example response payload model

The runtime should store raw user responses in method-specific but normalized format.

```json
{
  "response_id": "resp_001",
  "session_id": "sess_123",
  "item_id": "NEX-GMB-001",
  "method_family": "likert",
  "response_value": 4,
  "captured_at": "2026-04-05T10:15:21Z",
  "latency_ms": 5820,
  "page_index": 3
}
```

A cognitive response would use option keys instead.

```json
{
  "response_id": "resp_450",
  "session_id": "sess_123",
  "item_id": "NEX-GMB-220",
  "method_family": "cognitive_multiple_choice",
  "selected_option": "C",
  "captured_at": "2026-04-05T10:32:09Z",
  "latency_ms": 17120,
  "page_index": 14
}
```

## 19. API contract overview

    {"dimension_id": "D1-CE", "raw_score": 43, "standardized_score": 74.2},
    {"dimension_id": "D2-DC", "raw_score": 11, "standardized_score": 79.1}
  ],
  "qc_flags": [
    {"flag_code": "reverse_consistency_watch", "severity": "low"}
  ],
  "confidence": "High"
}
```

  "blueprint_status": "approved"
}
```

## 23. Workflow specifications

### 23.1 Candidate assessment workflow

| Step | Actor | System action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Candidate or admin | Session is created from a published form |
| 2 | Candidate | Completes assessment sections |
| 3 | Runtime | Validates responses and closes session |
| 4 | Scoring engine | Computes D1–D5 scores and QC flags |
| 5 | Governance engine | Applies restrictions and confidence logic |
| 6 | Reporting | Publishes candidate-safe report |

### 23.2 Context-aware fit workflow

| Step | Actor | System action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Admin/manager/assessor | Creates or selects a context record |
| 2 | Domain 6 engine | Computes person-in-context indices |
| 3 | Role blueprint service | Loads approved role blueprint |
| 4 | Role-fit engine | Computes fit score and band |
| 5 | Reporting | Publishes fit report with governance notes |

### 23.3 Role blueprint governance workflow

| Step | Actor | System action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Admin or agent-assisted intake | Captures role evidence |
| 2 | Blueprint service | Produces draft role blueprint |
| 3 | Reviewer | Reviews and edits blueprint |
| 4 | Governance lead | Approves or rejects |
| 5 | Analytics / validation team | Upgrades blueprint to validated after evidence review |

## 24. Reporting architecture

The platform should support at least four report audiences because one report cannot safely serve all purposes.

| Report type | Intended audience | Allowed content |
|---|---|---|
| **Candidate report** | Candidate or participant | High-level D1–D5 results, selective Domain 6 if enabled, development-safe language |
| **Admin report** | Assessment administrator | Full score grid, governance flags, completion metadata |
| **Assessor/manager report** | Development or placement use | Context-aware interpretation with confidence statements |
| **Role-fit report** | Recruiter, talent, or decision support team | Fit score, fit band, strengths, risks, blueprint status, explicit governance caveats |

Pilot or research outputs should only appear where governance rules permit them.

## 25. Security, privacy, and audit requirements

Because Nexus stores sensitive psychometric and role-evaluation data, the implementation should treat security and auditability as product requirements rather than infrastructure extras.

| Requirement | Minimum implementation expectation |
|---|---|
| **Access control** | Role-based access control for candidate, admin, assessor, manager, governance, and analytics roles |
| **PII separation** | Separate identity/PII tables from scoring outputs where possible |
| **Encryption** | Encrypt data in transit and at rest |
| **Audit trails** | Log scoring version, bank version, context version, role blueprint version, and report access |
| **Version reproducibility** | Every result must be reproducible from stored version metadata |
| **Report suppression rules** | Prevent blocked or provisional content from leaking into high-stakes outputs |
| **Data retention controls** | Support jurisdictional retention policies and deletion workflows |

## 26. Versioning strategy

Nexus will evolve. Engineering therefore needs a versioning strategy from day one.

| Versioned object | Why versioning is mandatory |
|---|---|
| **Item bank** | Item wording, governance state, and scoring logic may change |
| **Forms** | Operational forms can differ from master bank |
| **Norms / transforms** | Standardized scores must remain reproducible |
| **Domain 6 formulas** | Weights and mappings will evolve through validation |
| **Context templates** | Role contexts are governed objects |
| **Role blueprints** | Role requirements change over time |
| **Report templates** | Different releases may expose different content |

The result object should always record the full version chain used to produce it.

## 27. Calibration, analytics, and monitoring requirements

The platform should be designed to support post-launch psychometric monitoring. This means the engineering team must not throw away scoring internals after producing a report.

| Analytics requirement | Stored data needed |
|---|---|
| **Item performance tracking** | Item-level responses, keyed correctness, response times |
| **Reverse-item functioning checks** | Item-level non-cognitive data with reverse flags |
| **DIF analysis** | Group metadata and item response distributions under privacy controls |
| **Scale precision and reliability** | Raw and standardized dimension outputs, item-score matrices |
| **Form-equating or parallel-form review** | Form membership and bank version data |
| **Role-fit validation** | Blueprint versions, fit outputs, and downstream outcome linkage data |
| **Domain 6 validation** | Context record versions, Domain 6 outputs, and performance/decision-quality outcomes |

## 28. Frontend implementation requirements

The frontend should be built as a method-aware assessment runtime plus an admin/governance console. It should not be implemented as a flat survey page.

| Frontend surface | Main requirements |
|---|---|
| **Candidate runtime** | Session resume, progress save, method-aware rendering, accessibility, timing support, mobile-safe layout |
| **Admin console** | Bank version browsing, form publishing, session management, governance review |
| **Context form UI** | 17-field structured form, template prefill, free-text notes |
| **Role blueprint UI** | Evidence intake, dimension weighting, approval workflow |
| **Report UI** | Candidate-safe and admin-safe views with confidence and governance badges |

## 29. First-release implementation recommendation

The best initial engineering release is a governed **Phase 1 production shell** rather than a maximally ambitious all-at-once platform. The first release should support end-to-end execution while keeping the more experimental content properly controlled.

| Release component | First-release recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Questionnaire runtime** | Full support for current method families |
| **D1, D2, D4 reporting** | Operationally enabled |
| **D3, D5 reporting** | Research/pilot-only or suppressed depending on program mode |
| **Domain 6** | Enabled as derived layer when valid context exists |
| **Role-fit** | Enabled only against approved role blueprints |
| **Analytics logging** | Mandatory from launch |
| **Manual governance console** | Mandatory from launch |

## 30. Implementation sequence for the tech team

The user has consistently preferred a complete, structured plan rather than a sprint-only view. The engineering sequence below therefore follows the product architecture from foundation to full operational use.

| Sequence | Build objective | Main deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Establish data contracts and bank ingestion | Item schema validator, bank import service, versioned registry |
| **2** | Build assessment runtime | Session APIs, rendering engine, response capture |
| **3** | Implement scoring engine | Method scoring, reverse logic, aggregate scoring, standardization |
| **4** | Implement governance layer | QC flags, blocked-state suppression, confidence logic |
| **5** | Build reporting shell | Candidate/admin score output with permissions |
| **6** | Add context service and Domain 6 | Context form, template registry, CAI/DII engine |
| **7** | Add role blueprint workflow | Role evidence intake, approval flow, versioning |
| **8** | Add role-fit engine | Fit scoring, fit banding, strengths/risks, report view |
| **9** | Add analytics and calibration monitoring | Warehousing, psychometric dashboards, DIF review pipeline |
| **10** | Prepare validation-driven upgrades | Norm refinement, Domain 6 tuning, partial-credit SJT or IRT if justified |

## 31. Acceptance criteria

The first complete engineering implementation should be considered acceptable only if the following conditions are met.

| Acceptance area | Minimum criterion |
|---|---|
| **Schema fidelity** | Final bank imports without column loss or unsupported method combinations |
| **Scoring fidelity** | Reverse scoring, cognitive keys, SJT keys, and forced-choice mapping all execute deterministically |
| **Governance fidelity** | Blocked and provisional content is correctly suppressed or labeled |
| **Domain 6 fidelity** | CAI, DII, and secondary indices compute only from scored profile plus explicit context |
| **Role-fit fidelity** | Fit scoring uses only approved role blueprints |
| **Auditability** | Each result stores bank, norm, context, Domain 6, and blueprint versions |
| **Report safety** | Candidate and admin outputs obey permission and governance rules |
| **Calibration readiness** | Analytics data required for psychometric monitoring is preserved |

## 32. Recommended engineering conventions

| Area | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Primary language** | TypeScript for APIs and frontend, or Python for scoring microservices if preferred |
| **Data store** | PostgreSQL transactional core |
| **Background jobs** | Queue-based worker architecture for scoring and report jobs |
| **Configuration** | Versioned config tables for formulas, norms, and blueprint weights |
| **Testing** | Golden-file scoring tests, bank import tests, governance regression tests |
| **Observability** | Structured logs, job tracing, report access audit |

## 33. Final technical conclusion

Nexus should be implemented as a **governed assessment platform**, not merely a survey application. The correct production architecture is:

> **Questionnaire delivery -> D1–D5 scoring -> governance pass -> Domain 6 derivation -> role-fit evaluation -> audience-specific reporting.**

This separation preserves psychometric clarity, supports context-aware interpretation, and makes the system extensible for calibration, role-fit validation, and future product growth. The most important implementation rule is that **Domain 6 and role-fit must remain downstream derived layers**, while the questionnaire engine remains the governed source of person measurement.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Nexus** is a next-generation enterprise workforce assessment platform designed to measure broad human capability and behavioral expression across all job levels — from entry-level to executive — through one governed, multidimensional measurement architecture.

Nexus is not a questionnaire product. It is a **regulated measurement ecosystem** built on five foundations: (1) a scientifically grounded construct architecture spanning 6 domains, 35+ dimensions, and 170+ facets; (2) a multimethod, adaptive item and scoring engine; (3) a role-fit and contextual alignment architecture; (4) a deterministic, policy-governed reporting engine; and (5) a four-ring enterprise governance and ethics framework.

### The Six-Domain Architecture

Nexus organizes human measurement into six domains, each serving a distinct scientific and business purpose:

- **Domain 1 — Personality Architecture** ("Character and Work Style"): The stable dispositional backbone, anchored in the Big Five and Integrity family. Active at V1.
- **Domain 2 — Cognitive Architecture** ("Thinking and Problem Solving"): Reasoning and complexity-processing capacity, scored through a separate cognitive IRT engine. Active at V1.
- **Domain 3 — Motivational and Driver Architecture** ("Drivers and Motivation"): What energizes and sustains effort. Deferred to Phase 2 pending dimension reduction analysis and culture-specific validation.
- **Domain 4 — Emotional and Social Functioning** ("Emotional Intelligence and Relationships"): Self-regulation, social awareness, resilience, and collaboration. Active at V1.
- **Domain 5 — Applied Work and Leadership Expression** ("Workplace Effectiveness"): Business-facing behavioral synthesis. Deferred to Phase 2.
- **Domain 6 — Contextual Alignment and Decision Indices** ("Fit and Readiness Indices"): Derived outputs including role fit, readiness, and risk indices. Restricted; most deferred to Phase 2 or later.

### V1 Scope: Two Use Cases Only

V1 launch is restricted to exactly two use cases: **Developmental Feedback** and **Hiring Support with Validated Role Blueprints**. All other use cases — including leadership readiness, executive readiness, team fit, and all risk outputs — are deferred. The Derailment Risk Index is **BLOCKED entirely** pending independent criterion validity review and independent ethics review.

### Governance Model

Nexus operates under a four-ring governance model covering Scientific, Ethical, Enterprise, and Operational governance. Every scored output must pass a seven-priority rule precedence hierarchy (P1 Absolute Block through P7 Audience Gate) before it may be shown. The reporting engine is deterministic: every output resolves to one of six controlled states (VISIBLE, VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION, DOWNGRADED, HIDDEN, BLOCKED, NOT_GENERATED).

### Why This PRD Is the Single Authoritative Reference

This document consolidates all prior Nexus specification documents — the PRD, construct map, scoring standard, reporting framework, role-fit validity framework, governance document, executable reporting rules, logic architecture, six-domain scoring map, detailed scoring specification, and construct registry — into one implementation-ready reference. All 28 governance fixes from the Nexus Full Governance Review v4 are incorporated as binding mandates, clearly marked with `> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE**` callouts throughout.

This document is the final working specification for implementation and validation planning. It is not a claim of final scientific closure: confidence thresholds, synthesis weights, and some governance rules remain policy definitions awaiting empirical refinement.

---

## KEY DECISIONS AT A GLANCE

> The following 10 governance mandates are non-negotiable. They are binding at all system layers and may not be overridden by product, engineering, or commercial decisions without Ethics Committee and Chief Psychologist approval.

| # | Decision | Mandate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **V1 scope is two use cases only** | Only `developmental` and `hiring_support_validated_blueprint` use cases are permitted at V1. All others are suppressed at the reporting engine level. |
| 2 | **Derailment Risk Index is BLOCKED entirely** | The DRI must not appear in any report, API output, UI element, sales material, or demo until independent criterion validity and ethics review are complete. |
| 3 | **Values Alignment is never a standalone selection criterion** | Values Alignment is restricted to developmental use only at V1. The reporting engine must suppress it in all selection-context sessions. |
| 4 | **No omnibus total-person score** | Nexus must never collapse a person into one master number. Dimensions are the primary measured unit. Domain summaries are optional. |
| 5 | **Role fit requires a validated blueprint** | Role-fit scoring is blocked unless `blueprint_status: validated`. Draft and under_review blueprints may not be used for operational scoring. |
| 6 | **GGUM calibration minimums are pre-launch gates** | D1, D2, and D4 must meet calibration minimums (N ≥ 500/item for GGUM; N ≥ 300/item for IRT) before V1 launch. No exceptions. |
| 7 | **Audit logging failure blocks all operations** | If the audit logging service is unavailable, ALL scoring and reporting operations must be blocked. The system must never silently degrade. |
| 8 | **Consent is per-use-case, not global** | A single blanket consent form is not sufficient. Candidates must provide separate, revocable consent for each distinct use case. |
| 9 | **Cross-cultural deployment requires measurement invariance** | Nexus must not make cross-cultural score comparisons or apply global norms until invariance is established. Domain 3 carries a culture-specific validation flag for all non-Western deployments. |
| 10 | **Score versioning is mandatory on every output** | Every scored output must carry `scoring_version` and `synthesis_weight_version` tags. Scores from different major versions may not be directly compared. |

## PART 0: PRODUCT DOCTRINE AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 0.1 What Nexus Is

**Nexus** is a next-generation enterprise workforce assessment platform designed to measure broad human capability and behavioral expression across all job levels — from entry-level to executive — through one governed, multidimensional measurement architecture.

Nexus is not a questionnaire product. It is a **regulated measurement ecosystem** that combines:

1. A scientifically grounded construct architecture (6 domains, 35+ dimensions, 170+ facets)
2. A multimethod, adaptive item and scoring engine
3. A role-fit and contextual alignment architecture
4. A deterministic, policy-governed reporting engine
5. A four-ring enterprise governance and ethics framework

> **Nexus generates valid, interpretable, permissioned, and use-bounded outputs. It determines not only what can be measured, but what can be scored, what can be shown, what can be used for which purpose, and what must be blocked.**

### 0.2 Core Product Doctrine

> **Nexus is a dynamic, multidimensional workforce assessment platform designed to measure broad human capability and behavioral expression across job levels while maintaining scientific discipline, ethical boundaries, enterprise governance, and deterministic reporting control. The primary measured outputs are validated dimensions supported by facets where appropriate. Domain summaries are optional. Derived outputs such as role fit, readiness, and risk are permissioned and never equivalent to direct traits. Role fit depends on an approved and, where required, validated role blueprint. Confidence, validation status, blueprint maturity, response quality, use case, and audience permissions jointly determine what may be shown or used. No omnibus total-person score is permitted. This PRD is final for implementation and validation planning, but not a claim of final scientific closure.**

### 0.3 Product Principles

| Principle | Product Meaning |
|---|---|
| No omnibus total-person score | Nexus never collapses people into one master number |
| Dimensions before domains | Dimensions are the primary reportable measured unit |
| Domains are optional summaries | Domain scores exist only when they add interpretive value |
| Facets support depth, not noise | Facets are narrow measured components where validated |
| Derived outputs are permissioned | Role fit, readiness, and risk require additional gates |
| Equal weights are the default | Unequal weights require theory, evidence, and governance approval |
| Response quality matters | Invalid or low-quality response patterns affect release decisions |
| Reporting is deterministic | Visible outputs are governed by explicit rule states |
| Role fit depends on blueprint validity | Title alone can never define fit |
| Scientific maturity must be declared | Final spec ≠ final proof |

### 0.4 V1 Launch Scope — TWO USE CASES ONLY

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Critical Fix, Task 12**

**V1 launch scope is restricted to exactly two use cases. All other use cases are deferred. This restriction is non-negotiable.**

| # | Use Case | Permitted Outputs | Governance Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Developmental Feedback** | All measured dimension scores (confidence-gated), facet scores where SE ≤ 0.35, behavioral descriptors, developmental suggestions, confidence chips, omission explanations | Standard — trained-user interpretation required |
| 2 | **Hiring Support with Validated Role Blueprints** | Role-linked dimension scores only (confidence-gated), role blueprint match indicators (validated blueprint only), structured interview prompts. No omnibus fit score. No readiness index. | Controlled — HR governance sign-off on blueprint required |

**V1 Explicitly Excluded Use Cases:**

| Use Case | Reason | Earliest Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Talent advisory / succession | Requires longitudinal validity evidence | Phase 2 |
| Leadership Readiness Index | Requires criterion validation from leadership outcomes | Phase 2 |
| Executive Readiness Index | Requires criterion validation from executive outcomes | Phase 2 |
| Team Fit / team composition | Requires team-level validation | Phase 2 |
| Values Alignment as any decision input | High adverse impact risk; developmental only with governance approval | Phase 2 (developmental only) |
| Derailment Risk Index | **BLOCKED ENTIRELY** — ethically indefensible without independent criterion validity review | Post-Phase 2; requires independent ethics review |
| Percentile reporting (global norms) | Global norm groups not yet established | Phase 2 |
| Cross-cultural deployment outside English | Measurement invariance not yet established | Phase 2 |
| All Domain 6 contextual indices (general) | Restricted until external criterion validity studies complete | Phase 2 or later |

**V1 Enforcement Rules:**

| Rule | Specification |
|---|---|
| Use case gate | Every session must carry a `use_case` tag. Only `developmental` and `hiring_support_validated_blueprint` permitted at V1 |
| Blueprint validation gate | Hiring Support requires `blueprint_status: validated` before role-linked output is scored |
| Output suppression | Non-permitted outputs suppressed at reporting engine level, not just hidden in UI |
| Commercial gate | Sales must not offer, demo, or contract any excluded use case until Phase 2 criteria are met |
| Audit log | `use_case` tag and all suppressed output types written to session audit log |

## PART 2: CONSTRUCT ARCHITECTURE — ALL SIX DOMAINS

### 2.1 The Six-Domain Framework

The construct hierarchy is:

```
Facet → Dimension → Optional Domain Summary → Permissioned Derived Index
```

| Domain | Status | Core Question | Primary Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain 1: Personality Architecture | Directly measured | How does this person tend to behave across situations? | Foundational noncognitive profile |
| Domain 2: Cognitive Architecture | Directly measured | How does this person reason, learn, and process complexity? | Reasoning and complexity capacity |
| Domain 3: Motivational and Driver Architecture | Directly measured (Phase 2) | What energizes, sustains, and directs this person? | Motivation, fit, retention, role preference |
| Domain 4: Emotional and Social Functioning | Directly measured | How does this person regulate self and navigate others? | Emotional-social functioning |
| Domain 5: Applied Work and Leadership Expression | Directly measured + validated synthesis (Phase 2) | How do underlying tendencies show up in work behavior? | Business-facing behavior reporting |
| Domain 6: Contextual Alignment and Decision Indices | Derived only | How well does the person align with a role, team, or environment? | Fit, readiness, governed decision support |

---

<a name="domain-1"></a>
### 2.2 DOMAIN 1: Personality Architecture

**V1 Status: Active — Required for V1 Launch**
**Scoring Engine: Default Noncognitive (GGUM/Bayesian Ideal-Point)**
**Scientific Anchor: Big Five + Integrity Family**
**Enterprise Display Name: Character and Work Style**

| Dimension | Definition | Final Facets | Scientific Anchor | Business Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Conscientious Execution** | Tendency toward order, discipline, reliability, and task completion | Dependability, Organization, Self-Discipline, Follow-Through, Time Discipline | Conscientiousness | Work ethic, reliability, execution consistency |
| **Interpersonal Orientation** | Tendency toward cooperative, considerate, and prosocial behavior | Cooperation, Tact, Empathy, Respect, Conflict Restraint | Agreeableness | Teamwork climate, service style, trustworthiness in interaction |
| **Emotional Steadiness** | Tendency toward composure and emotional balance under stress | Stress Tolerance, Composure, Recovery Speed, Frustration Control, Pressure Stability | Emotional Stability / low Neuroticism | Resilience baseline, pressure handling |
| **Exploratory Openness** | Tendency toward curiosity, imagination, and comfort with novelty | Curiosity, Conceptual Range, Learning Appetite, Creativity, Ambiguity Tolerance | Openness to Experience | Innovation style, learning orientation |
| **Social Assertiveness** | Tendency toward social energy, voice, influence, and outward confidence | Social Confidence, Voice, Influence Projection, Visibility Comfort, Energy Expression | Extraversion | Presence, persuasion, leadership emergence |
| **Integrity Orientation** | Tendency toward honesty, fairness, humility, accountability, and non-exploitation | Honesty, Fairness, Rule Regard, Accountability, Humility, Non-Exploitation | Honesty-Humility / Integrity Family | Ethics, trust, misconduct risk protection |

**Scoring Example — Conscientious Execution (5 facets):**

```
S(Conscientious Execution) = (θ_Dependability + θ_Organization + θ_SelfDiscipline + θ_FollowThrough + θ_TimeDiscipline) / 5
```

**Optional Domain 1 Summary:**
```
D1 = (1/6) × Σ S_d   for d = 1 to 6
```

**Governance Notes:**
- Integrity Orientation requires stronger response-quality review and integrity validation track
- All 6 dimensions active at V1 (subject to GGUM calibration completion)
- Discriminant validity tests DV-01 and DV-02 required before V1 launch

---

<a name="domain-2"></a>
### 2.3 DOMAIN 2: Cognitive Architecture

**V1 Status: Active — Required for V1 Launch**
**Scoring Engine: Cognitive IRT (3PL Logistic)**
**Enterprise Display Name: Thinking and Problem Solving**

| Dimension | Definition | Final Facets | Scientific Anchor | Business Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Verbal Reasoning** | Ability to understand, analyze, and reason with language | Comprehension, Inference, Argument Evaluation, Language Precision | Verbal reasoning ability | Communication reasoning, policy comprehension |
| **Numerical Reasoning** | Ability to reason with quantities, relations, and quantitative evidence | Numerical Comparison, Quantitative Inference, Applied Numeracy, Data Pattern Recognition | Quantitative reasoning ability | Analytical rigor, data-based decision support |

| **Strategic Systems Thinking** | Ability to reason across interconnected systems and second-order effects | Systems Mapping, Second-Order Thinking, Scenario Integration, Long-Horizon Logic | Systems reasoning / strategic complexity | Executive complexity capacity |

**Cognitive IRT Scoring (3PL):**
```
P(X_i = 1 | θ_c) = 1 / (1 + exp[-a_i(θ_c - b_i)])
```
Where: θ_c = cognitive ability, a_i = item discrimination, b_i = item difficulty.

**Governance Notes:**
- Separate cognitive engine — never mixed with noncognitive scoring
- Minimum calibration: N ≥ 300 per item; N ≥ 1,500 per dimension
- Verbal items are language-dependent; metric invariance required before cross-cultural cognitive comparison

---

<a name="domain-3"></a>
### 2.4 DOMAIN 3: Motivational and Driver Architecture

**V1 Status: DEFERRED TO PHASE 2**
**Scoring Engine: Default Noncognitive (GGUM)**
**Enterprise Display Name: Drivers and Motivation**

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Tasks 18 + 27**

Domain 3 is deferred to Phase 2. Dimension reduction analysis must be completed before operational use. Domain 3 carries a **culture-specific validation flag** for all non-Western deployments.

**Current 7-Dimension Structure (Pre-Reduction):**

| # | Dimension | Definition | Reduction Hypothesis |
|---|---|---|---|
| D3-1 | Achievement Drive | Motivation toward accomplishment, progress, and excellence | Retain |
| D3-2 | Security Drive | Motivation toward predictability, safety, and stability | Bipolar pair with D3-3 |
| D3-3 | Autonomy Drive | Motivation toward independence, self-direction, and ownership | Bipolar pair with D3-2 |
| D3-4 | Affiliation Drive | Motivation toward belonging, loyalty, and positive connection | Retain |
| D3-5 | Learning Drive | Motivation toward growth, mastery, and self-expansion | Consolidation candidate with D3-6 |
| D3-6 | Purpose Drive | Motivation toward meaning, mission, and contribution | Consolidation candidate with D3-5 |
| D3-7 | Recognition Drive | Motivation toward status, visibility, and external validation | Retain |

**Target 5-Dimension Structure (Post-Reduction, Conditional):**

| # | Dimension | Derived From | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| D3-1 | Achievement Drive | D3-1 unchanged | Confirmed by discriminant validity |
| D3-2 | Security–Autonomy Orientation | D3-2 + D3-3 collapsed (bipolar) | Confirmed if r(D3-2, D3-3) ≤ −0.60 |
| D3-3 | Affiliation Drive | D3-4 renumbered | Confirmed by discriminant validity |
| D3-4 | Growth and Purpose Drive | D3-5 + D3-6 consolidated | Confirmed if r(D3-5, D3-6) ≥ 0.70 |
| D3-5 | Recognition Drive | D3-7 renumbered | Confirmed by discriminant validity |

**Culture-Specific Validation Flag:**
```
domain: D3
flag_type: CULTURE_VALIDATION_REQUIRED
flag_status: ACTIVE
applies_to: all_non_anglo_western_deployments
blocking: true
```

| Construct | Cross-Cultural Risk |
|---|---|
| Achievement Drive | HIGH — collectivist cultures may express achievement through group success |
| Autonomy Drive | HIGH — Western individualist value; high power-distance cultures may suppress expression |
| Recognition Drive | HIGH — status expression varies significantly by cultural display norms |
| Security Drive | MODERATE |
| Affiliation Drive | MODERATE |
| Purpose Drive | MODERATE |
| Learning Drive | LOW-MODERATE |

<a name="domain-4"></a>
### 2.5 DOMAIN 4: Emotional and Social Functioning

**V1 Status: Active — Required for V1 Launch**
**Scoring Engine: Default Noncognitive (GGUM) with Active Exception Monitoring**
**Enterprise Display Name: Emotional Intelligence and Relationships**

| Dimension | Definition | Final Facets | Business Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-Awareness** | Ability to notice, understand, and reflect on internal states | Emotional Insight, Self-Reflection, Signal Recognition, Pattern Awareness | Self-insight |
| **Self-Regulation** | Ability to manage impulses, emotions, and reactions productively | Impulse Management, Emotional Discipline, Recovery Control, Response Modulation | Emotional intelligence in action |
| **Social Awareness** | Ability to perceive others accurately and appreciate interpersonal cues | Perspective Taking, Empathic Recognition, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Social Signal Reading | Interpersonal sensitivity |
| **Relationship Management** | Ability to maintain productive relationships and repair friction | Trust Building, Conflict Handling, Influence Tone, Repair Behavior, Boundary Management | Collaboration effectiveness |
| **Resilience Capacity** | Ability to recover, persist, and adapt under stress or setbacks | Bounce-Back Speed, Persistence, Reframing Capacity, Endurance, Setback Tolerance | Resilience |
| **Team Collaboration Style** | Typical way of contributing within interdependent work | Coordination, Reciprocity, Information Sharing, Role Flexibility, Collective Accountability | Teamwork style |

**Governance Notes:**
- Self-Regulation: restricted to developmental use only until DV-02 discriminant validity test is resolved
- Exception monitoring priority: HIGH for emotional-social functioning and resilience constructs
- Minimum calibration: N ≥ 500 per item; N ≥ 2,500 per dimension

---

<a name="domain-5"></a>
### 2.6 DOMAIN 5: Applied Work and Leadership Expression

**V1 Status: DEFERRED TO PHASE 2**
**Enterprise Display Name: Workplace Effectiveness**

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Tasks 22 + 23**

Domain 5 synthesis relations are validation hypotheses, not scoring shortcuts.

| Dimension | Definition | Primary Source Logic | Business Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Work Style** | Typical pattern of planning, pacing, structure, and execution | Partly direct, partly D1/D3 informed | Work style |
| **Leadership Expression** | Tendency and capability to set direction, mobilize others, and hold standards | Direct applied items + validated synthesis | Leadership |
| **Execution Discipline** | Consistency in translating intent into delivery | Direct applied + D1/D3 overlap | Execution strength |
| **Communication and Influence** | Ability to communicate clearly and shape understanding or action | Applied direct + D2/D4 support | Communication impact |
| **Adaptability** | Behavioral flexibility under change, novelty, and disruption | Direct applied + D1/D2/D3/D4 support | Agility |
| **Judgment and Decision Quality** | Quality of practical work decisions under constraints and consequences | Hybrid with D2 and Integrity input | Judgment |
| **Team Contribution** | Functional value added by the person to collective work | Direct applied + D1/D4 support | Teamwork contribution |
| **Culture Contribution** | Typical effect on norms, climate, and standards | Applied synthesis | Culture shaping tendency |

**Mandatory Caveats:**

> *"Leadership Expression is a synthesis dimension. At V1, it is supported by self-report indicators only. Multi-model evidence (SJT, 360, behavioral observation) is required before Leadership Expression is used in any selection or high-consequence context."*

> *"Judgment and Decision Quality scores reflect general tendencies in practical reasoning and ethical choice. These scores are not domain-specific. Judgment quality in a specific professional domain requires domain-specific validation before this dimension is used for selection in that domain."*

**D5 Provisional Synthesis Weights:**

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Immediate Priority Fix, Task 10**

All D5 synthesis weights carry `synthesis_weight_version: 1.0.0-provisional`. Equal weights are in use for all synthesis and domain summaries.

### 2.7 DOMAIN 6: Contextual Alignment and Decision Indices

**V1 Status: RESTRICTED — Most indices deferred to Phase 2 or later**
**Enterprise Display Name: Fit and Readiness Indices**

Domain 6 outputs are never direct traits. They are derived algorithmic interpretations.

| Index | Definition | Governance Status | V1 Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Role Fit** | Person-to-role alignment against approved role blueprint | Permissioned | Hiring Support only; validated blueprint required |
| **Team Fit** | Person-to-team alignment against team model | Permissioned | Phase 2 |
| **Values Alignment** *(developmental use only — NEVER for selection)* | Person-to-culture alignment | Highly restricted | Phase 2 (developmental only) |
| **Leadership Readiness** | Readiness for people-leadership scope | Restricted | Phase 2 |
| **Executive Readiness** | Readiness for enterprise-scale complexity | Restricted | Phase 2 |
| **Derailment Risk Index** | **BLOCKED — Not Defensible for V1** | **BLOCKED ENTIRELY** | Post-Phase 2; requires independent criterion validity + ethics review |
| **Development Priority Index** | Estimated development leverage area | Advisory | Phase 2 |

<a name="part-3"></a>
## PART 3: CONSTRUCT RELATIONS AND NOMOLOGICAL NETWORK

### 3.1 Relation Hierarchy

| Level | Relation Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | Facet-to-dimension | Facets are narrow manifestations of one dimension |
| Level 2 | Within-domain dimension relation | Dimensions in the same domain may correlate but must remain distinguishable |
| Level 3 | Cross-domain adjacency | Dimensions in different domains may show meaningful association |
| Level 4 | Synthesis relation | Domain 5 constructs may be supported by validated lower-layer contributors |
| Level 5 | Derived relation | Domain 6 indices consume validated dimension scores but are never direct traits |

### 3.2 Strong Expected Relations

| Construct A | Construct B | Expected Relation | Product Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conscientious Execution | Execution Discipline | Strong positive | Stable discipline should support delivery behavior |
| Conscientious Execution | Work Style | Strong positive | Planning and structure influence work pattern |
| Emotional Steadiness | Resilience Capacity | Strong positive | Composure supports stress recovery |
| Interpersonal Orientation | Team Collaboration Style | Strong positive | Cooperation supports collaborative behavior |
| Social Assertiveness | Leadership Expression | Strong positive | Assertiveness supports visibility and mobilization |
| Social Awareness | Relationship Management | Strong positive | Reading others supports managing relationships |
| Self-Regulation | Judgment and Decision Quality | Strong positive | Regulation supports better practical decisions |
| Learning Drive | Learning Agility | Strong positive (cross-domain) | Motivation to learn supports applied learning expression |
| Exploratory Openness | Adaptability | Strong positive | Openness supports behavioral flexibility |
| Integrity Orientation | Culture Contribution | Strong positive | Integrity shapes climate and norm impact |
| Verbal Reasoning | Communication and Influence | Strong positive (not identity) | Language reasoning supports communication quality |
| Strategic Systems Thinking | Executive Readiness | Strong positive in derived models | Systems reasoning supports enterprise-level readiness |

### 3.3 Required Separations (Discriminant Validity)

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Task 17**

The discriminant validity threshold for all Nexus construct pairs is **r < 0.70** (latent correlation from CFA).

| Pair ID | Construct A | Construct B | Pre-Launch? | Action if r ≥ 0.70 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DV-01 | Conscientious Execution | Achievement Drive | **YES — V1 pre-launch** | Subordinate one under the other |
| DV-02 | Emotional Steadiness | Self-Regulation | **YES — V1 pre-launch** | Self-Regulation subordinated as facet |
| DV-03 | Social Assertiveness | Leadership Expression | Phase 2 | Leadership Expression restricted to synthesis-only |
| DV-04 | Integrity Orientation | Ethical Choice (D6 facet) | Phase 2 | Ethical Choice facet removed if redundant |
| DV-05 | Security Drive | Autonomy Drive | Phase 2 | Collapse into single bipolar dimension |
| DV-06 | Learning Drive | Purpose Drive | Phase 2 | Consolidate if r ≥ 0.70 |

**Discriminant Validity Testing Protocol:**

| Step | Procedure | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| 1. CFA model specification | Two-factor CFA for each pair | CFI ≥ 0.95, RMSEA ≤ 0.06 |
| 2. Latent correlation | Extract r with 95% CI | r < 0.70 = confirmed |
| 3. Threshold evaluation | Compare against 0.70 | r ≥ 0.70 = resolution required |
| 4. Fornell-Larcker | AVE_A > r² AND AVE_B > r² | Required |
| 5. HTMT ratio | Supplementary evidence | HTMT < 0.85 required |
| 6. Resolution | Apply resolution action | Document in Construct Registry |

Minimum N: 300 per test. Chief Psychologist sign-off required for any resolution decision.

## PART 4: ITEM AND ASSESSMENT ARCHITECTURE

### 4.1 Multimethod Design

| Method Family | Primary Use | Best Suited For |
|---|---|---|
| Likert Self-Report | Efficient direct measurement | Stable noncognitive traits, drivers, work style tendencies |
| Forced-Choice / Comparative Items | Reduce desirability; improve trade-off behavior | Personality, drivers, leadership style, work tendencies |
| Scenario-Based Judgment Items | Contextualized behavioral reasoning | Judgment, integrity, leadership, collaboration, adaptability |
| Cognitive Reasoning Items | Performance-based reasoning measurement | Verbal, quantitative, abstract reasoning, decision complexity |
| Applied Work Simulations | Higher-fidelity work expression | Leadership, communication, prioritization, judgment |

### 4.2 Item Bank Structure

| Item Bank Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| primary_domain_id | Mandatory |
| primary_dimension_id | Mandatory |
| primary_facet_id | Mandatory unless direct-dimension item |
| secondary_dimension_ids | Optional; maximum two |
| loading_type | direct, adjacent, or synthesized |
| intended_meaning | One-sentence construct definition |
| prohibited_overlap | Constructs the item must not represent |
| validation_status | draft, pilot, validated, production |
| item_method_type | self-report, forced-choice, SJT, simulation, cognitive, other |
| intended_population | Validated job levels, industries, languages, regions |
| reading_level | Supports fairness and accommodations |
| psychometric_parameters | IRT/CTT statistics |
| exposure_controls | Manages overuse in adaptive or secure forms |
| bias_dif_review_status | Subgroup fairness evaluation |
| security_classification | Developmental vs. high-stakes use |
| revision_lineage | Version history and retirement status |

### 4.3 Multidimensional Item Design Rules

> Each item must measure one primary facet or dimension clearly, and may carry no more than two validated secondary loadings, each justified by theory and confirmed statistically.

| Pattern | Allowed? |
|---|---|
| One facet, one dimension | Yes |
| One primary facet + one adjacent secondary facet | Yes |
| One primary applied dimension + one lower-layer contributor | Yes, with care |
| One item spanning three adjacent constructs | Only if validated and very clear |
| One item spanning unrelated domains | No |
| One item measuring direct trait and derived fit index | No |

### 4.4 Adaptive Routing Architecture

| Construct Family | Recommended Adaptive Approach | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Cognitive measures | Full item-level CAT where psychometrically justified | Maximizes precision and efficiency |
| Broad trait measures | Multistage or shadow-test assembly | Preserves content balance and interpretability |
| Leadership and behavioral scenarios | Stage-based routing by job level and prior responses | Maintains realism and contextual comparability |
| Motivation and values | Limited adaptivity or fixed balanced forms | Excessive adaptivity may distort ipsative meaning |
| Integrity module | Exposure-controlled multistage design | Reduces coaching risk and protects security |

## PART 5: SCORING ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 Five-Layer Scoring Architecture

| Layer | Purpose | Production Status |
|---|---|---|
| Layer 1: Noncognitive Scoring | Estimate traits, drivers, emotional-social tendencies, collaboration, resilience, integrity indicators | Core |
| Layer 2: Cognitive Scoring | Estimate reasoning and cognitive performance | Core |
| Layer 3: Contextual Indices | Compute role fit and other context-bound outputs from validated inputs | Derived and permissioned |
| Layer 4: Confidence Scoring | Quantify uncertainty and determine reporting eligibility | Mandatory |
| Layer 5: Governance | Control activation, interpretation, use case, and release permissions | Mandatory |

> **Nexus measures first, summarizes second, matches third, and decides only under restricted governance.**

### 5.2 Noncognitive Scoring Engine (GGUM / Bayesian Ideal-Point)

```
U_ij(θ) = exp(-a_ij × ||θ - b_ij||²)

P(Y_i = j | θ) = U_ij(θ) / Σ_k U_ik(θ)

L(θ) = Π_i P(Y_i = y_i | θ)

Prior: θ ~ N(0, I)
Posterior: p(θ | Y) ∝ p(θ) · L(θ)
Final estimate: θ̂ = E[θ | Y]
```

### 5.3 Cognitive Scoring Engine (3PL IRT)

```
P(X_i = 1 | θ_c) = 1 / (1 + exp[-a_i(θ_c - b_i)])
```
Where: θ_c = cognitive ability, a_i = item discrimination, b_i = item difficulty.

### 5.4 Facet, Dimension, and Domain Scoring

```
If dimension d has M_d validated facets:
  S_d = (1/M_d) × Σ θ̂_dm   for m = 1 to M_d

If no validated facet split:
  S_d = θ̂_d

Optional domain summary (domain g with K_g validated dimensions):
  D_g = (1/K_g) × Σ S_d   for d = 1 to K_g
```

> **Dimensions are primary measured outputs. Domain scores are optional summaries only.**

### 5.5 Percentile Conversion

```
Percentile_k = Φ(θ̂_k) × 100
```
Allowed **only** when θ̂_k is on a validated reporting scale with an established norm group.

### 5.6 Role-Fit Scoring

```
Fit(r) = Σ w_d × f(S_d, T_d) / Σ w_d   for d = 1 to K

Default similarity function:
  f(S_d, T_d) = 1 - |S_d - T_d|

Default: w_d = 1 for all dimensions unless evidence justifies otherwise.
```

### 5.7 Score Versioning

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Immediate Priority Fix, Task 9**

Every scored output must carry two mandatory version tags:

| Tag | Type | Definition | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scoring_version` | Semantic version | Complete scoring engine version | `1.0.0-provisional` |
| `synthesis_weight_version` | Semantic version | Weight set for synthesis/aggregation | `1.0.0-provisional` |

**Version Increment Rules:**

| Change Type | When to Increment | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|
| Major (x.0.0) | Fundamental change breaking score comparability | Chief Psychologist + Ethics Committee + Global Validation Council |
| Minor (0.x.0) | New dimensions, new confidence rules | Chief Psychologist sign-off |
| Patch (0.0.x) | Bug fixes, calibration corrections | Engineering lead sign-off |

**Cross-Version Comparison Rules:**

| Scenario | Rule |
|---|---|
| Same major + minor version | Direct comparison permitted |
| Same major, different minor/patch | Comparison permitted with version disclosure |
| Different major version | Direct comparison NOT permitted |
| Different synthesis_weight_version | Derived index comparison NOT permitted |

### 5.8 Confidence and Precision Model

```
SE_k = sqrt(Var(θ_k | Y))
CI_k = θ̂_k ± 1.96 × SE_k
```

**Production Confidence Bands (V1 Policy Thresholds):**

| Confidence Band | Standard Error Rule | Internal Code | Reporting Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| High | SE ≤ 0.25 | `HIGH` | May be shown for all approved report types |
| Moderate | 0.25 < SE ≤ 0.35 | `MODERATE` | May be shown for development use; consequential use requires additional controls |
| Low | 0.35 < SE ≤ 0.45 | `LOW` | May be shown only as exploratory, visually downgraded |
| Unacceptable | SE > 0.45 | `UNACCEPTABLE` | Hidden from user-facing reports |

*These are working operational policy thresholds, not final scientific constants.*

### 5.9 Method-Variance Correction

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Critical Fix, Task 11**

**Method-Variance Flags:**

| Flag | Condition | Reporting Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `MV_CLEAN` | ω_method ≤ 0.15 AND MBI ≤ 0.30 for all contributing methods | Full synthesis score released |
| `MV_CAUTION` | ω_method 0.15–0.25 OR MBI 0.30–0.50 for any method | Synthesis score released with caution; confidence band widened by one tier |
| `MV_HIGH` | ω_method > 0.25 OR MBI > 0.50 for any method | Synthesis score suppressed; single best-method score released |
| `MV_UNRESOLVED` | Method-variance calibration not yet completed | Cross-method synthesis BLOCKED; single-method score only |

**V1 Method-Variance Status:**

| Construct | Methods in Synthesis | V1 Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Integrity Orientation | Self-report + SJT | Single-method (self-report) only; selection use BLOCKED |
| Self-Regulation | Self-report + SJT | Single-method (self-report) only; selection use BLOCKED |
| Leadership Expression | Self-report + SJT + 360 | Single-method (self-report) only; selection use BLOCKED |
| Emotional Steadiness | Self-report + scenario | Single-method; developmental use permitted |
| Cognitive constructs (D2) | Performance + self-report | Performance-only scoring at V1 |
| Domain 1 personality | Self-report + forced-choice | Equal-weight provisional synthesis; `MV_UNRESOLVED` flag applied |

### 5.10 GGUM Calibration Minimum Sample Requirements

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Task 20**

| Scoring Model | Application | Min N per Item | Min Total N per Dimension |
|---|---|---|---|
| GGUM (noncognitive) | D1, D3, D4 self-report | 500 | 2,500 |
| 3PL IRT (cognitive) | D2 performance items | 300 | 1,500 |
| Forced-choice (Thurstonian IRT) | D1/D3/D4 forced-choice | 500 | 2,500 |
| SJT scoring (Phase 2) | D4/D5 situational judgment | 300 | 1,500 |

**GGUM Model-Data Fit Requirements:**

| Fit Index | Minimum Standard | Preferred Standard |
|---|---|---|
| CFI | ≥ 0.95 | ≥ 0.97 |
| RMSEA | ≤ 0.06 | ≤ 0.04 |
| SRMR | ≤ 0.08 | ≤ 0.05 |
| Q3 residual correlations | All Q3 < 0.20 | All Q3 < 0.15 |

**Calibration Status Flags:**

| Flag | Condition | Operational Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `CALIBRATION_COMPLETE` | N meets minimum; model-data fit meets all standards | Available for operational scoring |
| `CALIBRATION_PROVISIONAL` | N meets minimum; fit meets minimum but not preferred | Developmental use only; not for selection |
| `CALIBRATION_INSUFFICIENT` | N below minimum for any item | BLOCKED from all operational use |
| `CALIBRATION_FIT_FAIL` | Model-data fit below minimum standard | BLOCKED; item revision required |
| `CALIBRATION_EXPIRED` | Calibration data > 3 years old | Flagged for re-calibration; continues with caution flag |

### 5.11 Cognitive–Noncognitive Module Counterbalancing Protocol

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Task 19**

Fixed ordering of cognitive before noncognitive is **prohibited** unless a specific scientific rationale is documented and approved.

| Condition | Module Order | Assignment Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Condition A (Cognitive-first) | D2 → D1 → D4 → D3 (if active) | 50% of sessions via random allocation |
| Condition B (Noncognitive-first) | D1 → D4 → D3 (if active) → D2 | 50% of sessions via random allocation |
| Condition C (Interleaved) | D1 → D2 (short block) → D4 → D2 (short block) | Phase 2 only |

**Fatigue Monitoring Thresholds:**

| Indicator | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Response time acceleration (noncognitive) | Mean RT drops > 30% from first to last quartile | Flag session; apply RQ modifier |
| Response time acceleration (cognitive) | Mean RT drops > 25% from first to last quartile | Flag session; apply cognitive RQ modifier |
| Completion time vs. norm | Total time < 40% of norm | Flag for speed-through review |
| Late-session omission spike | Omission rate in final 20% > 3× rate in first 20% | Flag for fatigue-related omission |

### 5.12 Weighting Policy

**Default Rule:** Equal weights for all facet-to-dimension and dimension-to-role-fit aggregations.

**Unequal-Weight Approval (all four conditions required):**

| Requirement | Rule |
|---|---|
| Theoretical basis | Written rationale exists |
| SME support | Relevant stakeholders agree |
| Empirical support | Unequal weights materially improve predictive or interpretive performance |
| Governance sign-off | Approved and version-controlled |

### 5.13 Output Eligibility Formula

```
Eligible(O) = Validation(O) × Confidence(O) × Permission(O)
```
Where each term is binary (0 or 1). If Eligible(O) = 1, the output may be shown.

### 5.14 Score Generation Sequence

| Step | Decision |
|---|---|
| 1 | Estimate facet or dimension scores using the appropriate scoring engine |
| 2 | Compute standard errors and confidence bands |
| 3 | Apply validation status checks to each score |
| 4 | Derive dimension scores from facets where approved |
| 5 | Derive domain summaries only if domain rules are met |
| 6 | Evaluate whether blueprint status permits role fit |
| 7 | Evaluate whether contributing dimensions meet confidence thresholds |
| 8 | Compute role fit only if blueprint, confidence, and use-case permissions all pass |
| 9 | Suppress, downgrade, or label outputs according to reporting policy |
| 10 | Log output status for audit and governance review |

## PART 6: VALIDITY STATES AND RESPONSE QUALITY

### 6.1 Assessment Validity States

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Immediate Priority Fix, Task 8**

| Validity State | Trigger Conditions | Reporting Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `VALID` | All quality checks pass; confidence bands HIGH or MODERATE across all dimensions | Full interpretive report released |
| `PASS_WITH_LIMITS` | Minor quality concerns; one or more dimensions at LOW confidence; no severe flags | Partial report with caution codes |
| `VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE` | Session complete but severe/pervasive response-quality flags prevent reliable interpretation | No interpretive report released; session retained for audit |
| `INCOMPLETE` | completion_ratio < 0.85 | No report generated; re-assessment offered |
| `INVALID` | Structural integrity failure, identity concern, or disqualifying quality flag | Session voided; escalation triggered |
| `DEFERRED` | Report section cannot be generated now but may become available when specified conditions are met | Section shows "not yet available" chip with reason code |

**State Resolution Sequence:** `INCOMPLETE` → `INVALID` → `VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE` → `PASS_WITH_LIMITS` → `VALID`

**VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE Trigger Conditions:**

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---|---|
| All-low-confidence state | Every reportable dimension at LOW or UNACCEPTABLE confidence |
| Pervasive impression-management | IM severity = severe on 3+ domains |
| Cross-method consistency failure | Divergence > 1.5 SD on 2+ constructs requiring multimethod corroboration |
| Uniform response pattern | ≥ 60% uniform response across noncognitive items |
| Domain-level missingness | completion_ratio ≥ 0.85 but item-level missingness concentrated in ≥ 2 full domains |

**Candidate Communication for VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE:**
> *"Your assessment session was completed, but the response patterns recorded did not meet the quality standards required to generate a reliable report. No interpretive results have been produced. You may be invited to retake the assessment under standard conditions."*

**Retest Policy:**

| Scenario | Retest Eligibility | Waiting Period | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| First VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE | Eligible for one governed retest | Minimum 72 hours | Standardised administration; proctoring recommended for selection |
| Second VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE | Eligible for escalated review only | Minimum 14 days | Human review required before retest authorisation |
| Third occurrence | Retest suspended | Indefinite | Ethics Committee review required |

### 6.2 Per-Dimension Response-Quality Modifiers

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Immediate Priority Fix, Task 8**

| RQ Level | Definition | Reporting Action |
|---|---|---|
| RQ-0: Clean | No quality concerns | Full dimension score and narrative released |
| RQ-1: Minor | Minor inconsistency; within acceptable tolerance | Score released; internal flag logged |
| RQ-2: Moderate | Moderate quality concern (elevated IM, low person-fit, response-time anomaly) | Score downgraded to band-only display; caution chip shown; narrative suppressed |
| RQ-3: Severe | Severe quality concern (extreme inconsistency, straightlining, cross-method divergence) | Dimension score hidden; omission code triggered |
| RQ-4: Disqualifying | Quality failure renders dimension unmeasurable | Dimension marked `NOT_GENERATED`; contributes to VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE if ≥ 2 dimensions affected |

**RQ Assignment Rules:**

| Quality Signal | RQ Assignment |
|---|---|
| Person-fit z-score > 2.0 for this dimension's item set | RQ-2 |
| Person-fit z-score > 3.0 for this dimension's item set | RQ-3 |
| Impression-management = elevated for this domain | RQ-2 |
| Impression-management = severe for this domain | RQ-3 |
| Response time < 0.5s average for this dimension's items | RQ-3 |
| Variance = 0 (all identical responses) across this dimension | RQ-3 |
| Cross-method divergence > 1.5 SD for this construct | RQ-3 if multimethod required; RQ-2 otherwise |
| Missing items > 30% within this dimension | RQ-4 |

### 6.3 DEFERRED State

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Task 28**

| Trigger Code | Condition | Resolution Path |
|---|---|---|
| `DEFERRED_BLUEPRINT_PENDING` | Blueprint in `draft` or `under_review` status | Blueprint achieves `validated` status |
| `DEFERRED_NORM_PENDING` | Norm group being established but not yet approved | Norm group approved |
| `DEFERRED_MULTIMETHOD_PENDING` | Multimethod evidence not yet collected | Multimethod module completed |
| `DEFERRED_CONSENT_PENDING` | Candidate has not provided consent for this output type | Consent provided |
| `DEFERRED_CALIBRATION_PENDING` | Dimension calibration in progress (`CALIBRATION_PROVISIONAL`) | Calibration achieves `CALIBRATION_COMPLETE` |
| `DEFERRED_BLUEPRINT_INVALIDATED` | Role-fit score invalidated by blueprint version update | Re-scoring completed against new blueprint version |
| `DEFERRED_PHASE_2` | Section requires Phase 2 feature not yet activated | Phase 2 activation |

**DEFERRED vs. SUPPRESSED vs. OMITTED:**

| State | Meaning | Can Become Available? | User-Facing Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SUPPRESSED` | Blocked by P1–P5 governance rule; permanent for this session | No | "This section is not available for this report" |
| `DEFERRED` | Temporarily unavailable pending a resolvable condition | Yes — auto-generates when condition is met | "This section is not yet available" |
| `OMITTED` | Suppressed due to low confidence or insufficient data | No | Omission chip with reason code |

## PART 7: ROLE-FIT ARCHITECTURE

### 7.1 Role-Fit Process Layers

> The agent proposes, the evidence verifies, governance approves, and outcomes validate.

| Layer | Purpose | Decision Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Layer 1: Intake | Gather structured role evidence | No scoring yet |
| Layer 2: Translation | Convert evidence into dimension hypotheses | Agent recommends only |
| Layer 3: Verification | Test whether proposed dimensions match role demands | Minimum thresholds required |
| Layer 4: Approval | Governance review of final role blueprint | No operational use without approval |
| Layer 5: Validation | Compare blueprint against actual outcomes | Required for high-stakes operational use |

### 7.2 Required Role Evidence

| Evidence Category | Examples | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Role identity | Title, family, department, geography, business unit | Prevents generic profiling |
| Job purpose | Mission, expected outcomes | Defines success meaning |
| Key duties | Responsibilities and relative importance | Anchors demands |
| Decision scope | Autonomy, complexity, ambiguity, risk | Identifies leadership and cognitive demands |
| Stakeholder environment | Internal/external interaction and conflict load | Identifies interpersonal demands |
| Seniority | Entry, IC, manager, senior leader, executive | Changes construct meaning |
| Context | Remote, regulated, growth-stage, customer-facing | Changes weighting and relevance |
| Success indicators | Metrics of success | Supports criterion linkage |
| Failure risks | Typical derailers or failure points | Supports risk modeling |
| Non-negotiables | Compliance, ethics, safety, security | Supports governance |

### 7.3 Role Blueprint Object

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| role_id | Unique role identifier |
| role_title | Business title |
| role_level | Entry, IC, manager, senior leader, executive |
| job_family | Functional family |
| context_flags | Work environment and business context |
| critical_outcomes | Measurable success outcomes |
| critical_tasks | Ranked task list |
| required_dimensions | Included measured dimensions |
| excluded_dimensions | Explicitly excluded dimensions |
| dimension_weights | Importance weights for included dimensions |
| rationale | Written reason each dimension matters |
| evidence_sources | Job description, manager input, SME input, performance data |
| confidence_score | Completeness and agreement score |
| approval_status | draft, reviewed, approved, validated |
| blueprint_version | Semantic version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) |
| effective_date | ISO 8601 |
| approved_by | Name/ID of approving authority |

### 7.4 Blueprint Maturity States

| Status | Meaning | Role-Fit Permission |
|---|---|---|
| Draft | Incomplete or title-led | No user-facing role fit |
| Reviewed | Evidence gathered, awaiting sign-off | Internal design use only |
| Approved | Evidence adequate and governance signed | Development and exploratory role fit |
| Validated | Approved + criterion linkage established | Operational role fit |

### 7.5 Blueprint Quality Scorecard

```
BQ = 0.30E + 0.25C + 0.20S + 0.15W + 0.10R

Where:
  E = Evidence completeness (0–1)
  C = Construct clarity (0–1)
  S = SME agreement quality (0–1)
  W = Weight justification quality (0–1)
  R = Role-level specificity (0–1)
```

| BQ Score | Meaning | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| BQ < 0.70 | Weak blueprint | No role-fit output |
| 0.70 ≤ BQ < 0.85 | Adequate blueprint | Exploratory or development-only role fit |
| BQ ≥ 0.85 | Strong blueprint | Approved for operational role-fit (subject to other gates) |

### 7.6 Blueprint Versioning and Score Invalidation

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Task 25**

| Change Type | Definition | Score Invalidation Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `major` | Addition/removal of required dimensions; change to use-case permissions; change to adverse impact analysis results | **Immediate invalidation of all scores from prior version** |
| `minor` | Change to dimension weightings; change to benchmark thresholds | **Invalidation of scores older than 90 days from prior version** |
| `patch` | Typographical corrections; metadata updates; clarifications not affecting scoring | **No invalidation** |

**Score Invalidation Rules:**
- Every role-fit score must carry `blueprint_id`, `blueprint_version`, and `blueprint_effective_date`
- Invalidated scores carry `score_validity: BLUEPRINT_INVALIDATED` and must not appear in active hiring workflows
- HR admin must be notified within 24 hours of invalidation
- All blueprint version changes, invalidation events, and re-scoring events written to audit log

### 7.7 Adverse Impact Analysis

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Immediate Priority Fix (Role-Fit Validity Framework)**

Before any role blueprint is approved for operational use:

| Requirement | Specification |
|---|---|
| Protected group analysis | Adverse impact analysis across all protected group categories (race, gender, age, disability, national origin) |
| 4/5ths rule | Selection rate for any group must not be less than 4/5ths (80%) of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate |
| Documentation | Full adverse impact analysis report filed in blueprint evidence file |
| Remediation | If adverse impact detected, blueprint must be revised or additional validation evidence provided before approval |
| Ongoing monitoring | Quarterly adverse impact monitoring for all active blueprints |

<a name="part-8"></a>
## PART 8: REPORTING ARCHITECTURE

### 8.1 Core Reporting Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Measurement before interpretation | Start from validated measured scores |
| Dimensions before domains | Dimensions are the main report unit |
| Domains are optional | Include only when helpful |
| Derived outputs are permissioned | Role fit, readiness, and risk require additional gates |
| Uncertainty is operational | Low-confidence outputs are downgraded, hidden, or explained |
| Audience controls visibility | Different audiences see different outputs |
| Evidence controls language | Wording must match construct maturity and evidence status |
| Human oversight remains available | Consequential uses must support review |

### 8.2 Standard Assessment-to-Workplace Performance Disclaimer

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, High Priority Fix, Task 24**

The following disclaimer must appear in all Nexus reports:

> *"Assessment scores reflect measured tendencies and capabilities at the time of assessment. They are not direct measures of job performance. The relationship between assessment scores and workplace performance depends on the specific role, context, and use case, and requires validation evidence for the specific application. Assessment results should be used as one input among multiple sources of evidence in any talent decision."*

### 8.3 Five-Gate Reporting Pipeline

| Gate | Question | Possible Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 1: Assessment Validity | Is the assessment complete and valid enough for interpretation? | pass, incomplete, invalid |
| Gate 2: Score Eligibility | Is this specific score validated and allowed for this use? | eligible, restricted, ineligible |
| Gate 3: Confidence Status | Is the score precise enough to show? | high, moderate, low, unacceptable |
| Gate 4: Derived-Output Prerequisites | If derived, do all blueprint and dependency rules pass? | pass, partial fail, fail |
| Gate 5: Audience Release Rule | What is the final visible behavior for this audience? | visible, caution, hidden, blocked |

### 8.4 Output States

| Output State | Definition | User-Facing Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `VISIBLE` | All required gates passed | Show normally |
| `VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION` | Allowed with moderated interpretation | Show with caution chip and bounded language |
| `DOWNGRADED` | Shown in limited/exploratory form only | Reduced emphasis; excluded from summaries |
| `HIDDEN` | Not allowed for this audience or use case | Do not render |
| `BLOCKED` | Explicitly suppressed because prerequisites failed | Omit section; provide policy-based explanation |
| `NOT_GENERATED` | Report object never assembled because assessment-level conditions failed | No section or score object emitted |

### 8.5 Exact Confidence-Based Display Rules

| Confidence Band | Developmental | Talent Advisory | Selection Support | Restricted / High Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | VISIBLE | VISIBLE | VISIBLE | VISIBLE if otherwise allowed |
| Moderate | VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION | VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION | DOWNGRADED or HIDDEN | HIDDEN unless policy exception |
| Low | DOWNGRADED or HIDDEN | HIDDEN from summaries | HIDDEN | HIDDEN |
| Unacceptable | HIDDEN | HIDDEN | HIDDEN | HIDDEN |

**Exact Downgrade vs. Hide Rules:**

| Rule ID | Object Type | Use Case | Confidence | Final Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CF-01 | Facet | Developmental | Moderate | `VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION` |
| CF-02 | Facet | Developmental | Low | `DOWNGRADED` |
| CF-03 | Facet | Non-developmental | Low | `HIDDEN` |
| CF-04 | Dimension | Developmental | Moderate | `VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION` |
| CF-05 | Dimension | Developmental | Low | `DOWNGRADED` if not dependency; otherwise `HIDDEN` |
| CF-06 | Dimension | Talent advisory | Moderate | `VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION` |
| CF-07 | Dimension | Talent advisory | Low | `HIDDEN` |
| CF-08 | Dimension | Selection support | Moderate | `VISIBLE_WITH_CAUTION` only if not primary selection driver; otherwise `HIDDEN` |
| CF-09 | Dimension | Selection support | Low | `HIDDEN` |
| CF-10 | Domain summary | Any consequential | >25% of included dimensions below HIGH | `HIDDEN` |
| CF-11 | Derived output | Any | Any required input below required threshold | `BLOCKED` |
| CF-12 | Any object | Any | Unacceptable | `HIDDEN` |

### 8.6 Rule Precedence Hierarchy

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Critical Fix, Task 16**

Rules are applied in strict order. A higher-priority rule always overrides a lower-priority rule.

| Priority | Rule Category | Description | Override Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 — ABSOLUTE BLOCK** | Legal / ethical prohibition | Output prohibited by law, ethics policy, or governance mandate | Suppressed unconditionally; no lower-priority rule can release it |
| **P2 — VALIDITY GATE** | Assessment validity state | Assessment is `INVALID`, `INCOMPLETE`, or `VALID_BUT_UNINTERPRETABLE` | All scored outputs suppressed |
| **P3 — USE CASE GATE** | Use case permission | Output type not permitted for the assigned `use_case` | Output suppressed for this session |

### 8.11 Omission Explanation Matrix

| Code | Trigger | Candidate-Facing Text | Admin Text |
|---|---|---|---|
| OM-01 | Low confidence | "This result is not shown because the available evidence was not precise enough for reliable interpretation." | "Suppressed: SE threshold failed." |
| OM-02 | Restricted use | "This section is not included in this report format." | "Suppressed: permission rule failed." |
| OM-03 | Blueprint immaturity | "A fit estimate is not shown because the target profile has not yet met activation requirements." | "Blocked: blueprint state below minimum." |
| OM-04 | Assessment incomplete | "The assessment was not completed sufficiently to support a full interpretation." | "Not generated: completion threshold failed." |
| OM-05 | Response-quality concern | "Some interpretive sections are not shown because response quality conditions did not support reliable reporting." | "Restricted: response-quality severity threshold triggered." |
| OM-06 | Validation limit | "This result is still being evaluated for this use and is not included here." | "Suppressed: use-validation rule failed." |

### 8.12 Reporting Agent Contract

| Agent Function | Required Behavior |

### 8.13 Phased Rollout

| Phase | Scope | Allowed Outputs | Restricted Outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 (V1 Launch) | Core production launch | Validated dimension reporting, confidence chips, omission logic, audit log, partial release states | No readiness, no risk, no broad percentile use unless norming complete |
| Phase 2 | Governed role-fit launch + D3 + D5 | Approved/validated role-fit outputs, blueprint gating, section blocking | No risk outputs; readiness only pilot |
| Phase 3 | Advisory expansion | Selected facet drill-down, broader advisory views, validated percentile expansion | High-consequence derived outputs still restricted |
| Phase 4 | Advanced enterprise modules | Validated readiness or specialized indices for authorized contexts | Still no unrestricted omnibus outputs |
| Phase 5 | Mature ecosystem | Construct-family exceptions resolved, thresholds empirically refined, global localization hardened | Restricted outputs remain governed |

## PART 9: GOVERNANCE, ETHICS, AND ENTERPRISE VALIDITY

### 9.1 Four-Ring Governance Model

| Governance Ring | Primary Responsibility | Typical Owners |
|---|---|---|
| Scientific Governance | Construct definitions, scoring integrity, validation standards, revision thresholds | Chief Psychologist, psychometricians, scientific advisory board |
| Ethical Governance | Candidate rights, privacy, fairness, explainability, use boundaries | Ethics Committee, privacy lead, legal counsel, DEI/fairness reviewers |
| Enterprise Governance | Client configuration, use controls, auditability, deployment standards | Product Governance Council, enterprise admins |
| Operational Governance | Security, access control, item exposure, versioning, incident management | Platform operations, security, QA, compliance |

### 9.2 Six Ethical Pillars

| Ethical Pillar | Meaning for Nexus |
|---|---|
| Respect for Persons | Informed participation and understandable feedback |
| Purpose Limitation | Scores used only for disclosed, evidence-supported purposes |
| Proportionality | Burden and inference power must fit the use case |
| Fairness and Inclusion | Reduce avoidable bias and exclusion |
| Transparency and Explainability | Users should understand what was measured and what was inferred |
| Accountability and Remedy | Review, challenge, correction, and appeal pathways |

### 9.3 Fairness Architecture

| Fairness Layer | What Nexus Must Do |
|---|---|
| Design Fairness | Review wording, reading load, stereotypes, accessibility |
| Statistical Fairness | Monitor subgroup score patterns, DIF, local bias signals, adverse impact |
| Process Fairness | Standardize administration and accommodations |
| Interpretation Fairness | Avoid overclaiming from group means or fit outputs |
| Outcome Fairness | Monitor real decision consequences in deployments |
| Governance Fairness | Require escalation and remediation when thresholds are breached |

### 9.4 Behavioral Risk Indicators (BRI) Framework

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Critical Fix, Task 13**

The Derailment Risk Index is **BLOCKED entirely** and replaced by the BRI framework.

**Why the Derailment Risk Index Is Blocked:**
1. No criterion validity evidence
2. High adverse impact risk
3. Stigmatising language
4. No independent ethical review completed

**BRI Candidate Indicators (Provisional — Pending Criterion Validation):**

| BRI Code | Behavioral Indicator | Source Constructs | Validation Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| BRI-01 | Interpersonal friction under pressure | Low Agreeableness facets + Low Self-Regulation | Not yet validated |
| BRI-02 | Reliability risk in high-accountability roles | Low Conscientiousness facets + Low Follow-Through | Not yet validated |
| BRI-03 | Integrity concern in trust-critical roles | Low Integrity Orientation (SJT-confirmed only) | Not yet validated |
| BRI-04 | Emotional dysregulation under high stress | Low Emotional Steadiness + Low Self-Regulation | Not yet validated |
| BRI-05 | Resistance to feedback and development | Low Openness to Experience + Low Learning Orientation | Not yet validated |

**BRI Activation Requirements (all must be met before any BRI is operational):**
- Criterion validity study: N ≥ 300 with documented relationship to criterion anchor
- Independent ethics review: Written Ethics Committee approval
- Chief Psychologist sign-off
- Construct brief in Nexus Construct Registry
- Adverse impact analysis
- Release restriction confirmed in governance configuration

### 9.5 Values Alignment: Prohibition on Standalone Selection Use

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Critical Fix, Task 14**

| Rule | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Never a standalone selection criterion** | Values Alignment must never be used as a standalone criterion in any hiring, promotion, placement, or screening decision |
| **Developmental use only at V1** | Restricted to developmental reports only; may not appear in any selection-context report |
| **No selection-context release** | Reporting engine must suppress Values Alignment in any session with `use_case: hiring_support_validated_blueprint` |
| **Explicit consent required** | Candidates must provide explicit, separate consent before Values Alignment is scored or reported |
| **Approved culture model required** | May only be scored against an explicitly approved, documented organisational culture model |
| **Adverse impact monitoring mandatory** | Any deployment must include adverse impact monitoring across protected group categories; reviewed quarterly |
| **No composite use** | Must not be combined with other dimensions into a composite score or index |

### 9.6 Data Retention Policy

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Immediate Priority Fix**

| Data Category | Retention Limit | Deletion Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Raw item responses | 24 months from assessment date | Candidate deletion request OR retention limit reached |
| Derived scores (domain scores, indices) | 24 months from assessment date | Candidate deletion request OR retention limit reached |
| Narrative report outputs | 24 months from report generation date | Candidate deletion request OR retention limit reached |
| Audit logs (scoring version, session metadata) | 36 months (extended for legal defensibility) | Legal hold expiry or regulatory clearance |
| Anonymised aggregate research data | Indefinite (no PII linkage permitted after anonymisation) | N/A |

**2-Year Hard Limit:** No identifiable candidate data may be retained beyond 24 months without explicit renewed consent and documented business justification approved by the Ethics Committee.

**Deletion-on-Request:** All identifiable data must be purged within 30 calendar days of verified request.

### 9.7 Granular Per-Use-Case Consent Framework

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Immediate Priority Fix**

Consent is **not global**. Candidates must provide separate, informed, revocable consent for each distinct use case.

| Use Case | Consent Type | Revocation Right | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-hire screening (role-fit scoring) | Explicit opt-in, written or digital | Yes — revocation invalidates hiring use | Must name the specific role and employer |
| Developmental feedback report | Explicit opt-in, written or digital | Yes | Candidate retains copy if already delivered |
| Leadership readiness assessment | Explicit opt-in, written or digital | Yes | Must specify whether results are shared with manager |
| Team composition analysis | Explicit opt-in, written or digital | Yes | Must disclose who will see team-level data |
| Longitudinal tracking / re-assessment | Separate renewed consent | Yes | Prior consent does not carry forward |
| Research and product validation | Separate explicit opt-in (anonymised) | Yes | Data must be anonymised before research use |
| Third-party sharing (e.g., ATS integration) | Explicit opt-in naming the third party | Yes | Third party must be named; blanket consent not valid |

### 9.8 Privacy and Data Governance

| Principle | Operational Meaning |
|---|---|
| Data Minimization | Collect only what is required |
| Purpose-Bound Retention | Retain according to use case and policy |
| Role-Based Access | Restrict visibility by audience and authorization |
| Segmented Storage | Separate identity data from psychometric data where practical |
| Audit Logging | Log access, scoring version, report generation, and configuration changes |
| Deletion and Correction Rights | Support lawful data access, correction, and deletion |
| Model-Data Separation | Prevent ungoverned reuse for unrelated AI modeling |

### 9.9 Measurement Invariance Requirements

> **GOVERNANCE MANDATE — Governance Review v4, Critical Fix, Task 16**

> **Nexus must not make cross-cultural score comparisons, apply global norms, or use cross-cultural role blueprints until measurement invariance has been established across the relevant cultural clusters.**

**Required Cultural Clusters:**

| Cluster | Representative Regions | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Cluster 1: Anglo-Western | US, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand | **Highest — required for V1 English deployment** |
| Cluster 2: Northern/Western European | Germany, Netherlands, Scandinavia, France | Phase 2 |
| Cluster 3: East Asian | China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan | Phase 2 |
| Cluster 4: South/Southeast Asian | India, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines | Phase 2 |
| Cluster 5: Latin American | Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina | Phase 2 |

**Invariance Status Flags:**

| Flag | Condition | Deployment Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `INV_FULL` | Full scalar invariance confirmed | Cross-cultural comparison and global norms permitted |
| `INV_PARTIAL` | Partial scalar invariance; corrections applied | Cross-cultural comparison permitted with documented limitations; global norms blocked |
| `INV_METRIC` | Metric invariance only | Latent mean comparisons blocked |
| `INV_CONFIGURAL` | Configural only | Cross-cultural comparison BLOCKED |
| `INV_UNTESTED` | Not yet tested | Cross-cultural deployment BLOCKED |

### 9.10 Accessibility and Localization

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Reading Burden | Plain-language targets where compatible with construct meaning |
| Visual Accessibility | Screen-reader support, contrast, scalable text, keyboard access |
| Timing Accommodations | Extended time or timing waivers where psychometrically appropriate |
| Format Accommodations | Alternative formats without changing construct meaning |
| Language Access | Validated localization rather than informal translation |
| Measurement Equivalence | Test cross-language comparability before broad release |

### 9.11 Human Oversight Requirements

| Decision Context | Required Human Oversight |
|---|---|
| Developmental feedback | Standard trained-user interpretation |
| Internal talent review | HR or talent professional review |
| Selection and promotion | Qualified human decision-maker + documented multi-factor review |
| Executive or board-level use | Elevated review panel, documented rationale, and governance sign-off |
| Risk or derailment flags | Mandatory human review before any action |

### 9.12 AI Governance Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| No construct invention | AI cannot create unsanctioned score labels or psychological claims |
| No silent inference expansion | AI cannot infer clinical, medical, or protected-class judgments from assessment data |
| No bypass of permissions | AI-generated reports must respect score visibility and use restrictions |
| Explanation traceability | Narratives must map back to actual score architecture and evidence |
| Human review for high stakes | AI-assisted outputs in consequential contexts require human oversight |

## APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS

This glossary defines all technical acronyms, governance codes, flags, and status values used throughout this document.

---

### B.1 Psychometric and Statistical Terms

| Term | Full Name | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **θ (theta)** | Latent trait estimate | The estimated underlying trait level for a person on a given construct, expressed on a standardized scale (typically mean 0, SD 1). The primary output of IRT and GGUM scoring. |
| **SE** | Standard Error | The precision estimate for a theta score. Lower SE = higher precision. SE is the primary input to confidence band assignment. Formula: SE_k = sqrt(Var(θ_k given Y)). |
| **CI** | Confidence Interval | The range within which the true score is likely to fall. Computed as: CI_k = θ̂_k ± 1.96 × SE_k (95% CI). |
| **IRT** | Item Response Theory | A family of psychometric models that estimate a person's latent trait level from their item responses, accounting for item difficulty and discrimination. |
| **3PL IRT** | Three-Parameter Logistic IRT | The IRT model used for Nexus cognitive items. Parameters: a (discrimination), b (difficulty). Formula: P(X=1 given θ) = 1 / (1 + exp[-a(θ - b)]). |
| **GGUM** | Graded Generalized Unfolding Model | An ideal-point IRT model used for noncognitive items (personality, motivation, emotional-social). Assumes people endorse items closest to their own trait level, not items at the extreme. Appropriate for Likert-style attitude and personality items. |
| **CAT** | Computerized Adaptive Testing | A testing approach where item selection is adapted in real time based on the person's estimated trait level, maximizing precision with fewer items. |
| **CFA** | Confirmatory Factor Analysis | A structural equation modeling technique used to test whether a hypothesized factor structure fits observed data. Used for discriminant validity testing and measurement invariance. |
| **CFI** | Comparative Fit Index | A model fit index for CFA. Values ≥ 0.95 indicate acceptable fit; ≥ 0.97 is preferred. |
| **RMSEA** | Root Mean Square Error of Approximation | A model fit index for CFA. Values ≤ 0.06 indicate acceptable fit; ≤ 0.04 is preferred. |
| **SRMR** | Standardized Root Mean Square Residual | A model fit index for CFA. Values ≤ 0.08 indicate acceptable fit; ≤ 0.05 is preferred. |
| **DIF** | Differential Item Functioning | A statistical test for item-level bias. An item shows DIF if people from different groups with the same trait level have systematically different response probabilities. Items with DIF Δ > 0.10 are flagged for review or removal. |
| **HTMT** | Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio | A supplementary discriminant validity indicator. Values < 0.85 are required to confirm construct distinctiveness. |
| **AVE** | Average Variance Extracted | A convergent validity indicator. For discriminant validity (Fornell-Larcker criterion): AVE_A > r² AND AVE_B > r² must both hold. |
| **Q3** | Q3 Residual Correlation | A local independence diagnostic for IRT models. All Q3 values should be < 0.20 (preferred < 0.15). High Q3 indicates item pairs that share variance beyond the measured trait. |
| **SJT** | Situational Judgment Test | An item format presenting realistic work scenarios with response options. Used to measure judgment, integrity, leadership, and collaboration with reduced social desirability effects. |
| **CTT** | Classical Test Theory | The traditional psychometric framework based on observed scores, reliability coefficients, and item-total correlations. Used alongside IRT for item analysis. |
| **BQ** | Blueprint Quality Score | A composite score (0–1) assessing the quality of a role blueprint. Formula: BQ = 0.30E + 0.25C + 0.20S + 0.15W + 0.10R. Minimum BQ ≥ 0.70 required for any role-fit output. |

### B.16 Additional Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Facet** | A narrow, specific component of a dimension. Facets are the most granular measured units in Nexus. Multiple facets aggregate to form a dimension score. |
| **Dimension** | The primary measured construct unit in Nexus. Dimensions are the main reportable output. They aggregate from facets (where validated) and feed into domain summaries and derived indices. |
| **Domain** | A grouping of related dimensions. Domain scores are optional summaries — they exist only when they add interpretive value and all constituent dimensions meet confidence thresholds. |
| **Role Blueprint** | A governed document specifying which dimensions are relevant for a given role, their relative importance, and the evidence supporting those choices. Required for any role-fit scoring. |
| **Synthesis Relation** | A validated relationship between lower-layer dimensions (D1, D2, D4) and a Domain 5 applied behavior construct. Synthesis relations are validation hypotheses, not scoring shortcuts. |
| **Derived Index** | A Domain 6 output computed from validated dimension scores and contextual models (e.g., role blueprints). Derived indices are never direct trait measurements. |
| **Omnibus Score** | A single composite score collapsing all dimensions into one number. **Prohibited in Nexus.** No omnibus total-person score may be generated or reported. |
| **Impression Management (IM)** | A response-quality signal indicating the degree to which a person may be presenting themselves in an overly favorable light. Elevated IM triggers RQ-2; severe IM triggers RQ-3. |
| **Person-Fit** | A psychometric statistic measuring how well a person's response pattern fits the expected pattern given their estimated trait level. High person-fit z-scores indicate unusual or inconsistent responding. |
| **Adverse Impact** | A substantially different selection rate for a protected group compared to the highest-selected group. The 4/5ths rule (80% rule) is the primary operational threshold. |
| **Criterion Validity** | Evidence that assessment scores predict a relevant outcome criterion (e.g., job performance ratings, promotion, retention). Required before any use case beyond developmental feedback is activated. |
| **Measurement Invariance** | The property that a construct is measured in the same way across different groups (e.g., cultural clusters, demographic groups). Required before cross-group score comparisons are made. |
| **Norm Group** | A reference population used to convert theta scores into percentile ranks. Norm groups must be validated for the specific audience and use case before percentile reporting is permitted. |
| **SME** | Subject Matter Expert. A person with direct knowledge of a role's demands, used to validate role blueprints and item content. |
| **ATS** | Applicant Tracking System. A third-party HR technology platform. Any ATS integration requires explicit named-party consent from candidates. |
| **360 Feedback** | Multi-rater feedback from peers, direct reports, and managers. Used as a secondary method source for constructs like Leadership Expression. Requires method-variance calibration before synthesis. |
| **Ipsative** | A measurement approach where scores are relative to each other within a person (forced-choice), rather than absolute. Relevant to Domain 3 motivation measurement design. |
| **Configural Invariance** | The weakest form of measurement invariance: the same factor structure holds across groups, but loadings and intercepts may differ. |
| **Metric Invariance** | Factor loadings are equal across groups, but intercepts may differ. Latent mean comparisons are blocked at this level. |
| **Scalar Invariance** | Both factor loadings and item intercepts are equal across groups. Full cross-group score comparisons and global norms are permitted only at this level. |
| **Thurstonian IRT** | An IRT model for forced-choice item formats. Used for Domain 1, 3, and 4 forced-choice items. Minimum calibration: N ≥ 500 per item. |
